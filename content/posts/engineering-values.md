## No ego

- Be humble. No one is above any task.
- Admit what you don't know, and own up to your mistakes. Your knowledge and ability will show in other ways.

## Respect the process

- We have rules and guidelines for how most things are done to protect ourselves from making mistakes.
- Respect these policies and follow them whenever possible. Sometimes it's ok to bend the rules; just talk about it first.

## Build with confidence

- Recognize when fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) drive your decision-making. Aim to eliminate the source of that FUD.
- Invest in automation to do things more efficiently and with fewer mistakes.

## Always be delivering

- Focus on the problem and delivering a solution.
- Resist the plunge into pedantry, bikeshedding, and philosophy.
