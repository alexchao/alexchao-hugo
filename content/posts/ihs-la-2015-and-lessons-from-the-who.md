I expected my one day at the [International Horn Symposium](http://www.ihsla2015.com/) in Los Angeles to yield the excitement and energy usually afforded by conferences of a grand scale, but I instead walked away feeling ambivalent about my lot as a horn player. Oops. Still, I appreciated the closing words of horn player [J. Gregory Miller](http://miller-music.com/) recounting his experiences touring with English rock band _The Who_:

Oh, also, I bought a fancy-pants mute from [Ion Balu](http://balumusik.com/), who is quite the gentlemanly dude.
