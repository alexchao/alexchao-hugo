This year, I will turn 40. A phenomenon I've been struggling to reconcile as I approach this milestone is the reality that life continues to take its own twists and turns regardless of whether you're prepared for it to. We are always told to be skeptical of how our memory of events can skew their positive and negative affect, but I can't help but remember my experience as a twenty-something well into my mid-thirties as one of abounding optimism, as I bounced around the globe, chasing one stimulating opportunity to the next. This appetite for stimulation and exploration was a guiding force — both overtly and as an undercurrent — in my career choices, hobbies, and social interactions. I was at the center of my own world, and I defined myself according to the shape and depth of the inroads I made in each of these endeavors.

Facing this 40-year milestone, I now have authentically adult responsibilities on my plate, joined by a life partner and a new one not far off. Our living situation and plans give us only a 6-month window of certainty about where we will live. My career is also in a state of suspension, with the industry itself undergoing a major reshaping at the will of LLM technology, and my future place in it deemed uncertain.

Notes to finish:

These are the sobering conditions of this transitional stage in my life, but what I also notice is the weight of the state of world pressing on my outlook. Two reasons:

- Certain: I have changed. I pay more attention, and understand things better.
- Probable, but less certain: The world got more chaotic.

Things:

- I live in Taiwan. The threat of war with China looms always, despite the disinterest of the Taiwanese people.
- War in Russia.
- War in the middle east.
- Trump's second term.
- Impending reformation of the Democratic party.
- Greatest technological breakthrough of our time.

The only thing I hope to capture in this post is the stark contrast from one phase of life to the next, compounded by the surrounding context, that would have not been a compounding factor if not for an inner, personal change.
