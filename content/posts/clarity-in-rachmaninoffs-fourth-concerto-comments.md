Gee, how do you choose your selections? In any case, haven't ever heard the fourth concerto, and indeed, it is very different! The first movement's intro reminds me of Richard Strauss' Don Juan's rapid outburst of an intro and (since i haven't yet finished listening to the third movement) flute lines in the first movement sound almost like Ravel's Pavanne, and some of the rustic sounds make me think of Khachaturian for some reason! Perhaps, as you say, the music spills nostalgia...!

(oh and i mention khachaturian and ravel and strauss more for the feeling rather than the actual music itself) (it's been a while)

You're absolutely right, especially since those three were all alive and active during Rachmaninoff's life. Don Juan has the same explosive, building-from-the-ground-up opening. Which flute lines are you referring to though?

I'm listening to the first movement again, and towards the 7-8 minute mark, the interchange between the oboe/flute with the solo pianist is so nice...it does sound like Rachmaninoff is so wistful and nostalgic. (Almost all the more epic because of life and experience?) (I'm listening to it via this website) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9FOmqLr9Ys&feature=related Oh and I am trying to find that flute line, and was I seriously on crack...? I thought there was a solo flute line that was extended for a while, but where is it!??

Yeah, that's one thing about Rachmaninoff's concertos too; there's a little action for everyone in the orchestra... except maybe low brass. :) Thanks for the link; hadn't heard Ashkenazy's before.
