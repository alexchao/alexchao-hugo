I've been tired and uninspired lately, so I will just take a moment to rattle off some thoughts about **Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2 in F**.  Feel like I could give the Romantic era business a rest anyway. Our good friend Dmitri wrote a bunch of brooding, controversial symphonies, but in [this concerto](http://www.lala.com/#album/1009087791584687796 "Shostakovich Piano Concerto No. 2"), there is a nice slice of his more cheerful side, as can be found too in the _Festive Overture_ and ninth symphony.  Actually, the Andante movement is reminiscent of a Romantic adagio, but the rest of the work is a sprightly spattering of thematic variations and fingering exercises—the latter conceived as a joke for the composer's son.  Honestly though, how fun is this melody? \[caption id="attachment\_433" align="aligncenter" width="500" caption="Shostakovich, Piano Concerto No. 2, Opening theme"\]![Shostakovich - Piano Concerto No. 2](https://alexchaocom.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/82291-shostakovich-concerto2-theme1.png "Shostakovich - Piano Concerto No. 2")\[/caption\] What a curious concerto.
