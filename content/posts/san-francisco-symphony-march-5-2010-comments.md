Hey, thanks for stopping by. Shostakovich's music was never immediately accessible to me, but I'm starting to take to it more and more. I like the 5th symphony and the _Festive Overture_, but I don't know his other works well enough. I definitely need to explore his stuff a little more.

Friday would be a monster program with which to make your return to the symphony. ;) Report back if you make it out there!

Hey cool! Was just wondering cuz yOu seemed to like russian romantics. Typingon an itouch so fingers too clumsy for propertyping. The Borodin made me feel nostalgic for his string quRtet #14. Shostko ich hassome pretty strange things but i recommend his trio#1 that he wrote in school when he was in love and awkward and fuddyduddyish.!! And his symphony#5 does really rock!

Nice… wasn’t aware I had mobile visitors. I will definitely check out the trio, thanks! Some of the best art is probably the product of love, awkwardness, and fuddyduddyishness. Yes, Shosti wrote some strange things, but so did everyone else. ;)
