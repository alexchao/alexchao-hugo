The No. 3 (C-minor) etude from **Rachmaninoff**'s first set of _Ã‰tudes-Tableaux_, Op. 33 was omitted from the original publication and released posthumously. I haven't read anything that explains why, but it probably has something to do with one of its melodies making an appearance in his [fourth piano concerto](http://alexchao.com/2010/03/clarity-in-rachmaninoffs-fourth-concerto/ "Rachmaninoff, Piano Concerto No. 4"), written some fifteen years later.

I guess it's only expected that, as a composer, you would eventually come to realize that a particular figure might shine a little brighter in a different setting.
