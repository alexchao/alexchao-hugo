Hehe, the sound of the horn super trills of the horn in the excerpt and the image of the rest of the orchestra as you say "frantically making all sorts of noise" gives me this great mental picture---(I think I am going to be periodically referring to this image and the mental sounds during my hard day at work to prompt some solo giggles--teehee) Why do I find it so funny that it sounds like the sound literally SQUISHES all those other noises? (almost like the horns have just had it with all the other instruments taking all those fast lines and trills all the time)

Yeah. Basically, this is the horn's way of saying GTFO and STFU, courtesy of Antonin Dvorak.
