It's been over three years since I last opined here. It is troubling to think about how much time has passed, since I don't think I've been particularly productive as a musician since then. In that time, I've written essentially just two pieces and who knows how many 8-bar phrases of vapid melody that will never make it farther than the inside pages of my sketchbook.

The first piece was an [andante for horn and piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51PzOuaIt2k "Andante for Horn and Piano, Alex Chao"), which may be my only mature work at this point, and the second exists more as a short suite: incidental music for a [small play](http://www.mynameisrichardrozen.com "My Name is Richard Rozen") performed in Palo Alto.

Let's hope this is all just par for the course in the evolution of a distracted artist. Anyway, this is what I look like now, after three years of withdrawal from the blogosphere: ![IMG_20140524_194133](https://alexchaocom.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/325dd-img_20140524_194133.jpg?w=1024&h=768)

To the longtime readers, I owe a listening recommendation. For an accessible modern composer, check out Allan Stephenson and his [Concerto for English Horn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEfvNJYavL0 "Allan Stephenson - Concerto for English Horn").
