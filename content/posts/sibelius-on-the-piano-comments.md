i wonder if this is why there aren't that many renditions of sibelius works on piano :P

gee, i want to delete the above comments, and write instead: gee, i just realized that Sibelius was probably more in tune with himself and HONEST perhaps. Perhaps he realized that no one is REALLY a jack of all trades and that the capacity to be a paragon of something is more viable---because everyone has a particular magnetism to something. I wish I could find that clarity in myself so that I could still compose/write/create something and know that I was using my energies appropriately...sigh.

He had already done brilliantly without loving the piano, I can't begin to fathom what more memorable pieces he'd leave us if he had felt otherwise. I just listened to his 6th symphony again earlier, pure and simple, a carriage ride through the Scandinavian forest feels fitting...

@**Pika**: I hate how these are things we'll never know. But it's possible he just flat out didn't like the piano. For whatever reason, I'm partial to the idea that composers of that generation weren't _consciously_ thinking about mastering any particular genre; rather than think about their strengths, they would just _do_, and their strengths would be self-evident. Let me know if you find that clarity. :) @**dearestjean**: It's true; let us be thankful he invested as much time in symphonic forms as he did.

hehe, when I first read this entry, I was actually thinking of Sibelius' impromptu and valse triste, and whatnot, but then i had this flashback of being in highschool and sitting in on an orchestra rehearsal of the sibelius second symphony (I took lessons from the cellist in the orchestra) and fell in love with the piece. (The conductor was drunk i think hehe) anyhow, so i did a youtube search and found this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWLESuVkXVg but the final is parsed into 3. sigh... so beautiful...

Despite _Finlandia_, I never fully comprehended Sibelius’s nationalism until I heard the finale of that symphony. In a review of it in 1940, Virgil Thomson wrote that it was “vulgar, self-indulgent and provincial beyond description.” Words, words. Hah, a drunk conductor. That could either turn out really well or really, really badly.

i dunno if the concert itself went badly, but at least, the "bubbly" made for a great rehearsal--hehe
