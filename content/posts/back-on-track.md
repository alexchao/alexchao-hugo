About a year ago, I found myself listening to less and less classical music in my daily listening routine, replacing the late Romantic program on my playlist with a hodge podge of EDM tracks I managed to harvest from my Alesso radio station on Pandora. I'm not really sure how it happened, but I guess I was in the throes of a more... hormonal phase of music. ![EDM](https://alexchaocom.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/e9587-edm-stage-design-markus-schulz-spiritual-gateway-wallpaper.jpg) It was a concerning thing to be getting away from my classical predilections, but corrective measures weren't something that could be forced. Listening to my old favorites from Ravel, Tchaikovsky, and Dvorak just wasn't doing it for me. Anytime I plugged in my earphones, I caved in to an embarrassingly teenage compulsion for four-on-the-floor, synthed-out dance tracks. Fortunately, [discovering Arnold Bax](http://alexchao.com/2015/02/discovering-arnold-bax/ "Discovering Arnold Bax") tripped a switch in my head that has started to set my listening habits back on track. At the very least, I'm indulging these days in a far more balanced musical diet.
