Lately, I've been trying to construct in my mind a visual representation of what we as humans experience when we learn a new language. What has piqued my interest is the totality of the experience that accumulates over the course of several months to years at a time as the learner studies the language, and that which, in aggregate, entails the sensation of sudden knowing and apprehension when sounds and printed words start to almost miraculously make sense. I'm almost tempted to describe it as a slow crawl in all directions from a single starting point, through a vast expanse of unknown territory (and for the sake of drawing an analogy with our favorite real-time strategy games, let's color it in black). While the experience feels like one where newly mastered words suddenly begin flying into the learner's aural line of sight, this is an illusion.
