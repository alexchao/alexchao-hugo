First order of business: **I am living in Taiwan** (since August 19th). I am taking an 二胡 ([èrhú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu)) class, and thus far have learned the basics of bowing. The proper grip and bow placement is tricky, and having never played a string instrument, the entire experience is foreign to me. In the first two lessons, none of my previous musical training has volunteered itself to be of any use, and the class is furthermore taught entirely in Chinese, so you know, there's that.

Here I am being amazing. Mhm. Through my early fumbles handling the instrument, I have learned two important phrases:

*   **放鬆**: relax
*   **（太）用力**: (too much) exertion/force
