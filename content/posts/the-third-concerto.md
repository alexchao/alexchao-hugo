This last Saturday marked the 100th anniversary of Rachmaninoff's [third piano concerto](http://thethirdconcerto.com "Piano Concerto No. 3 by Rachmaninoff").  I don't know if there were any performances anywhere to commemorate the piece, but then again, we don't often commemorate _pieces_.  Usually, it's the life of the composer we celebrate. Still, I like to think about the significance of a musical work coming into existence, to fill an ethereal space where once there existed a musical void.  Before November 28th, 1909, **no one** knew what the third concerto by Rachmaninoff sounded like, save the composer himself.  Why?  Because it didn't exist!  Imagine that.
