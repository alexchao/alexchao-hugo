Out of a mostly irrational desire to witness two musical greats synergized in one absolutely fantastic display of awesomeness, I'd like to see **Yuja Wang** perform [Rachmaninoff's sonata](http://www.lala.com/#album/504684633535057868 "Rachmaninoff Piano Sonata No. 2").  The second one of course. The first one is great too, but let's face it, for a girl who professes a love for _those lyrical, big, romantic pieces_, [Mlle. Wang](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122867344 "Yuja Wang") can't go wrong with Op. 36.  And with Chopin's second already [under her belt](http://www.lala.com/#album/432627039258751292 "Yuja Wang - Sonatas and Etudes"), I'd only find it in the natural order of things. [![Yuja Wang](http://alexchao.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/yujawang.jpg "Yuja Wang")](http://yujawang.com)

Not that she hasn't already considered it.
