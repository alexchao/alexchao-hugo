They don't often talk about Rachmaninoff and the way his music changed over the course of his lifetime. And why should they? His contemporaries provide many more notable (and frankly interesting) examples of musical evolution and experimentation in the 20th century. Stravinsky went from something resembling Romanticism to serialism by the end of his life, and the Second Viennese School introduced a literally entropic sound to the classical world. All as if to throw Rachmaninoff in with Mozart and Beethoven. Still, while Rachmaninoff remained deeply rooted in tradition throughout his life, he didn't live in isolation. He knew very well what was taking place around him, and living in the United States for most of his later life placed him in relative proximity of men like Schoenberg, Prokofiev, and Gershwin. Their and others' influence on his music can be heard in the form of further dissonance and more complex, even jazzy harmonies.
