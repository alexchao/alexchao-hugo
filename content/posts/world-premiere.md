The aforementioned performance of my hymn took place this last Saturday in Mountain View at the [Community School of Music and Arts](http://www.arts4all.org/). Below is the one, very awful photo I have of the venue (Tateuchi Hall) from my seat in the back while I waited to go on stage myself. \[caption id="attachment\_805" align="aligncenter" width="584"\]![Tateuchi Hall, Community School of Music and Arts](https://alexchao-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/07/cdb98-img_20150620_171513.jpg?w=1024&h=768)

Tateuchi Hall, Community School of Music and Arts\[/caption\] The performance went well, I thought, given that we were only able to rehearse it once. I still think it's a hilarious thing that as a composer I get to call this occasion the _world premiere_ of my piece.

Special thanks to my teacher, Daniel Wood, as well as Selin, Linus, and Jimmy Haber who all volunteered to play the piece. Also, thanks to my friends Nick, Anthony, and Lilliana for coming!
