As one who adores the larger canine breeds, I felt compelled to make good on my [recent tweet](http://twitter.com/simonlife/statuses/22106297324 "Rachmaninoff had a dog") by providing proper visual aid. To be fair, the photograph makes no effort to establish the owner relationship between the two subjects, but as I tweeted, it's darn cute. ... though I wish people made a better effort to smile back in the day. \[caption id="attachment\_592" align="aligncenter" width="500" caption="Rachmaninoff and a Dog (senar.ru)"\]![Rachmaninoff and a Dog](https://alexchao-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/07/24d00-rach-dog.jpg "Rachmaninoff and a Dog")\[/caption\]
