If you like the augmented 5th / flat 6th when it falls into the 5th of a major chord, you will especially like the track called "Phantom Plains" from the score to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, composed by Elliot Goldenthal (who studied with both Copland and Corigliano). The track alternates between a major/minor sound until finally around 0:40 an augmented 5th resolves down to a B flat to form an E flat major triad. Very powerful presentation of this chord progression. Note how following the progression, the augmented triad is stated again, but the B natural / C flat moves to a C sharp to form an A major triad with the rest of the orchestra. I find that the progression you speak of is often used in sci-fi or fantasy films; so is the I to bV progression (aka the "major tritone progression"). I had a music history teacher in college who said he once read a scholarly paper where the author chronicled the use of the major tritone progression in sci-fi films. Here's a 2006 article I just found on the same subject (which apparently references the Goldenthal track too): http://mto.societymusictheory.org/issues/mto.06.12.2/mto.06.12.2.murphy.html

Thanks for the recommendation. That is indeed a very pronounced instance of the chord progression I was referring to. Yeah, I sort of glossed over the effect that this kind of figure has in modern, film score usage. I find that it evokes a sense of wonder and mystery, without being too in-your-face about it. Also, thanks for the link to the article. It brings up some passages in Holst that I need to revisit. =)
