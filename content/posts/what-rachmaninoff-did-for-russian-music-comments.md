I like that picture too! Bobby played a Rachmaninoff concerto. I forget which one. He still has it mostly memorized.

I think it's also important to note that Rachmaninoff was one of the last great \*performer\*-composers, who wrote music that he himself wanted to play. Modernism, and even more so ultramodernism, on the other hand, was pretty much dominated by non-performing composers.

@nac, yeah, also a good point. It's a wonder to me how any of them ever made a living, since my understanding is that Rachmaninoff was never without the financial pressure to tour and perform. Always wish we had footage of him at the piano...
