An interesting heads-up, Alex, thank you. I'm quite familiar with the Tchaikovsky symphonies - by far my favourite versions are the ones Rozhdestvensky recorded for Melodiya in the 1970s, but I recognise those recordings are firmly in the mainstream passionate Romanticist vein - so this will be a challenging listen, if I can track down copies. Much appreciated.

Thanks Bran. And I'm not familiar with the Rozhdestvensky recordings, so I'll need to give those a listen. Nothing shameful about mainstream passionate Romanticism.
