Yes! No itouch and a keyboard! I guess I have no excuses for typos anymore!>:$! w0ops!! Gee, it is very refreshing to read these excerpts online, and where classical music doesn't always equate to a critique of a performance (solely) or some blown-up commemorative. Anyhoo, enough of that spiel...I wonder if it was that Prokofiev had more ingenuity and inherent gift as a musical mathematician. (At least, although his pieces aren't as flashy as Rachmaninoff's, and perhaps less emotive, don't you think they carry a stronger intertextual expertise? I don't know...every time I listen to a Prokofiev Piano Sonata, it just feels so much "crunchier" to me. (I have no idea what that means...I guess, something similar to the depth that one can feel when one steps on just fallen snow? and how, each step presses on layers and layers of intricate snowflakes?)) Oh, and this is completely unrelated, but what are your feelings on Ravel? And do you like Ginastera's Variaciones Concertantes? (You do not have to answer these questions any time soon or answer them at all...) bleh !

sigh, no edit feature. um, well, oh, Perhaps the crunchiness is from the strain put on prokofiev---anyhow, I would like to nullify the statement that Rachmaninoff might not have as much artistic dexterity!

animosity makes history more interesting! Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev should have dueled it out! :P \*\* didn't make it to the hall on friday, but seeing a play this friday, getting somewhat cultured. \*\*\* just realized I've switched identity, but o well :)

@**Pika**: Sorry about no comment editing. :( I'm making a list in the back of my mind of things that I need to add to this blog. To your points comparing the two composers, I think Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev are different enough stylistically that saying that one of them is more \[X\] is just a way of restating the composer's idiom. That is, any greater faculty exhibited by one and not the other ("crunchiness," for example) just speaks to their divergent philosophies and ideals for making music. Whether Rachmaninoff was capable of writing "crunchy" music, it did not matter, because it was not in his style. Anyway, I don't think it was Prokofiev's ingenuity that got to him. ;) Ravel is awesome. Fantastic orchestrator. Don't know the Ginastera piece, but I'll find it and give it a listen. Thanks for the recommendation! @**dearestjean**: Have fun at the play!

Oh, speaking of which--- you know how sometimes, you can almost see shadows of a composer by the people who play his/her music in the present? Or those who CHOOSE or look as though they personify the music itself? Perhaps that would be a great way to see what a modern day Prokofiev and Shostakovich would look side by side. But speaking of Prokofiev, I once saw this awesome performance in an art gallery, where the video artist/artist/idea artist(?) had a huge projector set up and had a video streaming of two violinists performing the sonata for two violins, and in the corner, were situated two conservatory students who played the same very piece, in sync with the video, and, I thought the effect was really sublime. The streaming video was very old, and the piece seemed to transcend time; plus, you'd watch the fingers on the projection---then, watch the performers, and although one usually acknowledges the performer during a concert, and vice versa when listening to a recording---I thought it was the most perfect combination of both! It's strange. I love Dan Deacon, and Animal Collective, and all sorts of genres of music, but I must say, nothing can really make my brain and body soar like classical music.

What you say about the spirit of certain composers transcending time reminds me of Horowitz, whose standing as the supposed "Last Romantic" I've mostly bought into. Performance art is something that's pretty alien to me, so I guess I just take it for what it is. Actually the Prokofiev scenario you mention sounds pretty conservative as far as performance art goes, but sometimes it can really challenge what you know and think about art.

hrm, for the spirit of certain composers, I was more imagining some sort of strange temporal wormhole in which all performers of a certain vein or tradition (in today's world) would merge into one sorta of exponent of the composer's work. hehe and sorry bout the blurb on a "simultaneous prokofiev" (since it was more or less a past recollection to share) -- i was more recalling that moment, less for the art, and more for the inherent magic in the music itself. blegh.

Heh, that is some seriously abstract thinking... And don't be sorry; that's what blog comments are for. :)
