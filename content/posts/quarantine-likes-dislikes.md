In quarantine, I like:

*   Having an easy "out" from social obligations.
*   Not having to bother buying or preparing food for myself.
*   Alone time.
*   Generally, not having to be anywhere at any particular time.

I dislike:

*   Any food I do get isn't quite hot enough.
*   No physical exercise.
*   No dance parties (actual dance parties, like with a DJ and fabulous people).
*   Not being able to hang out with my close friends.
