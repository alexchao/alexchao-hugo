sidetracked a little by the topic of creative 'borrowing' ... when is it 'borrowing' and when is it 'plagiarizing'? I never fully understood. I mean I understand straight plagiarism if something has been copied word for word, note for note to its entirety or a big chunk of it. But when it comes to something more loose and abstract such as ideas/creativity, who is it to judge? Clearly, if McNeely admitted himself, then he may have been inspired by another. However, there are so many incidences where ideas are born via different brains without knowing the existence of the other, will the one whose idea became famous/registered/trademarked/published, etc first be the ORIGINAL??? what about the extreme lookalikes without any blood ties, who plagiarized there? The creator?

Ugh, the distinction between _borrowing_ and _plagiarizing_ is so ambiguous sometimes, and in fact, you could say that there really isn't a difference (i.e. the former being a mere euphemism of the latter). But naturally it depends on the degree and extent of the reproduction. There aren't any good rules to follow when it comes to music, so I don't have an answer for you. We know definitely that McNeely was inspired by and used at least one musical idea written by Ravel. It's not note for note, but I think the fact that I knew exactly where it came from the instant I heard it says something about its relative similarity to the source material. For the purists, this is all that matters. Personally, I'm more interested to know how this instance of borrowing sits with McNeely's conscience and sense of pride as an artist. For example, I think a written acknowledgment (in the score or on the album somewhere) goes a long way towards establishing respect and artistic license, but so far, I haven't seen anything like this. You could say we have every reason to believe that he tried to pawn this passage off as original material, but, to be honest, I don't feel like calling out a professional film composer on this kind of issue. For now, I'm securing a position of uncertainty for myself, which is totally boring but easy, noncommittal, and maybe even optimistic. As for the same idea being born of independent minds, each "copy" of the idea is original in its own right, but the first one to become published or widely distributed _will_ be the _de facto_ original, for all practical purposes. I don't necessarily think this is right, especially if the execution of the idea is the same across the board, but truthfully, the masses have little interest in origin stories. 99% of the people who played Shadows of the Empire could probably care less that some of the music came from existing classical works. And as for extreme lookalikes without blood ties, I think that's just plain ol' luck of the draw. =)

a little nitpicking; Shadows of the Empire was a "media event", that included a book, audio book, comic, toys, soundtrack and the game :)

a little late to the show, but after i listened to the score again after i don't know how many years, i came across your review. i have to say, very interesting to read and i immediately listened to the Walton piece you have mentioned. https://youtu.be/Ax-U0ONv4hY?t=9m24s this should definately sound familiar ;) anyway, i still love the music Joel McNeely wrote and just listening to it again makes me wonder why he wasn't approached to write music for a Star Wars movie.
