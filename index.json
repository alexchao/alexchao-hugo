[{"content":"I wonder if these marches manage to convince enough people to reduce their meat consumption to offset the ill will that they possibly sow.\nWhile wandering around in London\u0026rsquo;s Piccadilly Circus neighborhood, I stumbled upon what I later learned to be the National Animal Rights March. A sizable gathering of colorful and impassioned people, young and old, were marching down the street with signs and banners, advocating greater sensibilities for the treatment of animals and a wholesale prohibition on the consumption of animal meat.\nNational Animal Rights March — August 6, 2022\nStanding on the sidewalk as a spectator, I wondered how this scene would be received by the average passerby, and then again by the vaguely politically centrist Western adult whose value system is vulnerable to rational argument, but who also enjoys a juicy hamburger every now and then. Certainly, principal among the goals of this march was an increased concern for animal well-being, further cashed out by a reduction in the consumption of animal meat and greatly improved conditions for those animals raised for slaughter. But in that moment, I felt that the spirit of these goals was lost amidst the thunderous pounding of the drums and clamor of the numerous chants and rallying cries.\nHaving tried to give up or at least greatly reduce my intake of meat, I am sympathetic to the vegan cause, but my fear of bothering others with my choices has attuned my attention to some potential negative outcomes of this style of advocacy. In short, bombast taken to the street in this way seems to place the otherwise blameless onlooker on the receiving end of disproportionately severe moral reproof, as common among the signage wielded by these protesters are images of blood-letting and accusations of moral degeneracy on the part of greater society. I suspect that the reaction to this unfettered admonishment could be indignation, borne of a feeling that one has been judged for a crime not committed. \u0026ldquo;I had a chicken sandwich for lunch, and you call \u0026lsquo;murder.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; If not this, then there must at least be a wide swath of people who look upon such spectacle with disgust, if merely for its unsightliness and fanaticism.\nIn usual ruminating style, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a solution to offer, and can only again wonder out loud whether there is more harm being done here than good. Is there not a style of activism with enough gravitas to make one pause and consider the nature of suffering and its almost certain incidence in anything conscious more neurologically complex than a mouse (to draw the line somewhat conservatively)? Surely, there must be a way to strike the tone of a measured plea, and to calmly appeal to reason and compassion without drumming up (literally) so much agitation.\nCertainly, these marches manage to bring awareness to the very real atrocities in our factory farms, and admittedly, many of the slogans seem to make honest attempts to appeal to one\u0026rsquo;s sense of compassion. One must also acknowledge that many a hard-fought battle in the realm of civil discourse have only been won through boisterous public protest. However, if anything can be discerned from the latest patterns in the great experiment of modern society, terse, pithy slogans and witty pseudo-aphorisms delivered with incensed fervor tend to send our adversaries deeper into their nests, and so it seems the project of turning society\u0026rsquo;s attention on the well-being of non-human creatures could be muddied when all it seems to do is block downtown traffic and visit a cacophony upon all those in its path.\nFor now, I will continue to donate to Giving What We Can\u0026rsquo;s animal welfare fund.\n","permalink":"https://alexchao.github.io/posts/on-the-efficacy-of-vegan-marches/","summary":"I wonder if these marches manage to convince enough people to reduce their meat consumption to offset the ill will that they possibly sow.\nWhile wandering around in London\u0026rsquo;s Piccadilly Circus neighborhood, I stumbled upon what I later learned to be the National Animal Rights March.

In basic terms, the Agricultural Revolution was the period a little over 10,000 years ago when our species very gradually made the transition from subsisting as foragers and hunter-gatherers to settling down as farmers, living in settlements and villages with accompanying fields of domesticated crops and cattle. The ground that I have covered so far in the book has left me with an impression of this slice of history shaped by two main ideas.\nThe first is a statement about our effectiveness and superiority as a species above all others in the domains of cognition and fitness, which exploded with the preceding Cognitive Revolution some 70,000 years ago. There are many ways to characterize the dominance of Homo sapiens in ways that paint a favorable picture, but the first few chapters of Harari’s book admonish that it would be more honest to recognize this rise to the top during the Cognitive Revolution as the moment in history when Homo sapiens attained their status as the most destructive species on the planet (long before the Industrial Revolution made such a fact plainly obvious).\nThere are a few ways to measure this destructiveness, but the most telling for me is the fossil record, which contains a long list of animal species that went extinct in the last 70,000 years, and which tells of a mind-boggling scenario that seemed to play out time after time with the arrival of humans on the scene. As tribes of Homo sapiens made their way across the continents from Africa, and eventually into Australia and the islands of the Asia pacific, their arrival in each of these places was marked by a sudden disappearance of large numbers of local animal species. Through normal, sustenance-seeking hunting practices and deforestation in the form of controlled burning (for the purpose of creating open plains), it seems our ancestors systematically wiped a large percentage of the world’s fauna off the face of planet in just a few millennia. Shifts of this sort in the realm of biology usually take place over millions of years.\nOn this point alone, there are two interesting details:\nHomo sapiens did this inadvertently. Research seems to show that these animals, having never been exposed to humans before, simply could not cope with the pressures that normal hunting patterns and deforestation applied to the local ecosystem. Also, at the time (during and after the Cognitive Revolution but before the Agricultural Revolution), we were still hunter-gatherers organized into tribes of probably no more than 100 individuals. It’s highly unlikely such events were orchestrated en masse. The diversity and awesomeness among the fallen species are noteworthy. The fossil record shows these lands to have been inhabited by ostrich-like birds that grew to ten feet tall, rodents the size of bears, enormous saber-toothed cats, and 20-foot sloths. Amazing. Having grown up with dinosaur-centered media and science education, I find the idea of these gargantuan versions of modern creatures fascinating. The second point that has stayed with me after my reading thus far centers around what Homo sapiens managed to accomplish during the Agricultural Revolution that, paradoxically, guaranteed the longevity of certain animal species but still yet produced destructive consequences. With the transition away from a nomadic existence to one living in farms and villages, our species developed methods of domesticating animals that guaranteed the availability of certain foods. This practice of raising cattle for labor and sustenance, which began some 9000 years ago, has led to our current situation where the world is now populated by 1 billion cows, 1 billion pigs, an equal number of sheep, and roughly 25 billion chickens.\nBy evolutionary standards, these animals have attained something akin to success. Where proliferating copies of one’s DNA is a metric of such success, cows, pigs, sheep, and chickens have won out among non-human species. Unfortunately, the engine of evolution knows nothing of happiness and well-being, and given their current conditions and the methods we use to facilitate the proliferation of their DNA, they are also the most miserable animals in existence. Understanding that our species is responsible for both the rate of their population growth and the quality of life of each animal, it follows that we have procured in our farms and abattoirs an upsettingly large concentration of suffering visited upon conscious organisms.\nPondering this fact, I wondered if the concern that I extend to endangered species and those that are nearly extinct is skewed by bias, borne of the natural sympathy one might feel for a species on its proverbial last legs. As Harari mentions somewhere, the somewhat solitary life of a rhinoceros on the plains of Africa – even one belonging to a critically endangered species – is probably, in relative terms, not that bad. The threat of game hunters and other acute, human-related factors notwithstanding, the rhino is free to roam the plains and scrounge for food, encumbered mostly by everyday perils like disease, predators (what few rhinos have), and physical injury – all things that its ancestors already faced on a regular basis anyway.\nThe scale and depth of suffering in our slaughterhouses, by contrast, is really beyond comprehension. While it is certainly a sad thing to witness entire species at a time vanish into obscurity, when I put the two of these things next to each other as ethical concerns that demand attention, the mass suffering of billions of organisms trumps all.\n","permalink":"https://alexchao.github.io/posts/on-the-extinction-of-animal-species/","summary":"I’ve been reading Noah Yuval Harari’s Sapiens and have reached the chapter in the book where he tells of the profound impact that the Agricultural Revolution of our species had on ourselves and on the planet.

Among the things they touched on were science, humanism, politics, and artificial intelligence.\nAbout halfway into their conversation, Sam prompted Pinker to speak about the rise of the alt-right. In his response, Pinker first clarified that his conception of the alt-right did not center on what has become the prevailing caricature of that identity — that is, the khaki-wearing, torch-bearing, pseudo-warmongering, male white supremacist who rallied at public demonstrations all throughout 2016 and 2017. Rather, he described the alt-right a product of something more subtle and surreptitious. In my best attempt to summarize his words, he described it as a group of people (albeit still overwhelmingly white and male) who emerged organically as a reaction to political correctness and left-wing taboos making it impossible — or at the very least inconvenient — to explore certain topics through conversation and free expression.\nUnfortunately, I can\u0026rsquo;t remember if Sam or Pinker highlighted any specific taboos or such topics, but I imagine something akin to Charles Murray\u0026rsquo;s The Bell Curve was the assumed context here. If, for example, a research study were to yield results attesting to racial differences in intelligence among humans, its exposure in academia would be short-lived, since — as the argument goes — leftist and politically correct attitudes on university campuses have turned the classroom into a place that is hostile to broaching such subjects and discussing them openly. Presumably, an open discussion on any of these topics would be of a kind that raises challenges against gender equality, racial equality, and other positions sympathetic to protected classes.\nPinker went on to say that without a space where debates of this sort were welcome, those who found themselves privy to this roiling body of everything from research findings to half-baked ideas withdrew from the usual channels and carried their conversations into hidden forums, where they could share and exchange with other like-minded people. These groups suddenly saw themselves as the beneficiaries of information that began to take on a privileged and secretive character, given its taboo status in other places. Speaking generally, there is something empowering about holding secrets, and it\u0026rsquo;s this sense of power, derived from enjoying a monopoly on certain knowledge, that drove its bearers to take shape as a collective force.\nIf this phenomenon is at all what was operative in the formation of the alt-right, then it should be taken as an example that reaffirms the primacy of free speech and the challenges inherent in its implementation. If it\u0026rsquo;s the case that would-be alt-righters met any resistance to expressing their ideas in the usual academic and political forums, it likely was not in the form of formal, prohibited-speech rules or legislation (at least in the US). Rather, the resistance they met likely took the form of accusations of bigotry or racism, which, true or not, will handily shut down any conversation before it even starts.\n","permalink":"https://alexchao.github.io/posts/steven-pinker-and-sam-harris-at-the-dolby-theatre/","summary":"On March 14, I went to see the launch event of Sam Harris\u0026rsquo;s Waking Up Book Club, where he and Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker shared the stage at the Dolby Theatre to discuss Pinker\u0026rsquo;s new book Enlightenment Now and a range of philosophical topics.

A precise specification of the style is in fact written into the Barbershop Harmony Society\u0026rsquo;s Contest and Judging Handbook. The section that outlines contest entry requirements reads:\nBarbershop harmony is a style of unaccompanied vocal music characterized by consonant four-part chords for every melody note in a predominantly homophonic texture.\nOccasional brief passages may be sung by fewer than four voice parts.\nBarbershop music features songs with understandable lyrics and easily singable melodies, whose tones clearly define a tonal center and imply major and minor chords and barbershop (dominant and secondary dominant) seventh chords that often resolve around the circle of fifths, while also making use of other resolutions. Barbershop music also features a balanced and symmetrical form, and a standard meter.\nThe differences with modern a cappella are implied, mostly by way of the limitations this specification places on songs written for barbershop. Barbershoppers do not see these as limitations of course; rather, they are the defining principles that characterize barbershop purity in sound and style.\nFour-part chords for every melody note Major, minor, and dominant chords (mostly) Understandable lyrics, easily singable melodies Standard meter The first and bolded point is the kicker for me. Left only to the imagination, music that adheres to this rule might seem cumbersome and texturally uninteresting, and such criticism I think is actually fair. The texture of barbershop music tends not to vary too widely from song to song. However, it is this rule that gives barbershop singing its richness and wall-of-sound quality. There are, almost by definition, very few gaps in phrases and incomplete chords. Most importantly perhaps, it is the combination of this rule with the second (allowing only certain, simple chords) that allows for barbershoppers to \u0026ldquo;ring\u0026rdquo; chords — a topic for another day.\n","permalink":"https://alexchao.github.io/posts/discovering-barbershop/","summary":"Singing in a boys choir when I was younger and later singing with my high school chorus, there were few opportunities to perform a cappella music.

He recommended re-scoring the piece for horn octet, which would have the added benefit of doling out the longer phrases and high parts more fairly (as it is, the 2nd horn part has no rests), as well as enabling beefier chords.

Memorable performances from the day included the world premiere of a piece for horn quartet called VA 22211 and a horn choir rendition of an aria from Mendelssohn\u0026rsquo;s Elijah oratorio (\u0026ldquo;O rest in the Lord\u0026rdquo;). VA 22211, named in reference to the zip code of Arlington National Cemetery, pays tribute to our fallen heroes and explores a range of feelings from hymnal reverence to heroic fervor. The Mendelssohn selection felt to me more sacred and spiritual in an all-horn setting than in its original scoring for orchestra and soprano. Its cadential C major chord freed me of all worldly cares, if only for a few moments.\n","permalink":"https://alexchao.github.io/posts/south-bay-horn-day-2015/","summary":"This past Saturday, I attended South Bay Horn Day at Mountain View High School.

The second selection comes from Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s All-Night Vigil and features a call-and-response dialogue between solo voice and choir. It is more austere and modal than the first piece, but ends with a more familiar cadence into a B-flat major chord, reminding us of its author and his place in history. The descent to the low B-flat engineered for the basses awakens the passive listener.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have much to say about the other three selections, except that they are optimistic in their outlook and inspire quietude.\nI am a nonreligious person, but will readily admit to the merit of the vast library of music that we owe to centuries of music-making being largely a by-product of religious worship.

The portrait painted by this \u0026ldquo;Best Of\u0026rdquo; compilation is of a man who procured steadfast melodies and unrelenting sentimentality till the day he died. Beyond these works too, you won\u0026rsquo;t find much that deviates from this pattern. Relatively speaking, he didn\u0026rsquo;t have eras or periods of stylistic evolution like, say, Stravinsky. He didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be interested in intellectual or artistic \u0026ldquo;progress\u0026rdquo;. All that mattered to him was one thing:\nI always feel that my own music and my reactions to all music, remained spiritually the same, unendingly obedient in trying to create beauty.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re a historian or music critic, this proclamation is unexciting. All it does is confirm his place in history as an engineer of soulful tunes, living a few decades beyond Romanticism\u0026rsquo;s expiration date. And this is a fact that explains his eventual resting place in our culture: today, his music is concert hall headline stock provisioned to fill seats for brave new works and enigmatic older ones. It otherwise rarely surfaces in the classroom or academic forum. It is music for feeling, not for thinking.\nThe third concerto is kind of an exception though. It\u0026rsquo;s insanely difficult (I just take everyone\u0026rsquo;s word for it), which is a nice value-add in the eyes of those who might dismiss Rachmaninoff for the above reasons. It\u0026rsquo;s also quite long for a concerto, with a lot of unrepeated material and several ossias. In fact, the third concerto represents a lot of what Rachmaninoff contributed to Russian music, not just because of its status as a masterpiece (whatever that means), but because it fills some gaps in the Russian offering.\nNot that Tchaikovsky and The Five left too much to be desired, of course. There\u0026rsquo;s just a whole lot more to Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s music than its emotional content. Take for instance the sheer scale of his works. There is the third concerto, the four symphonies (three, plus the choral), the Symphonic Dances, and the sonatas (two piano and one cello). These are grand works with protracted underlying structures, and the symphonic pieces among them require large orchestral forces. It\u0026rsquo;s my own opinion, but writing on this scale deserves recognition alongside his peers Mahler and Sibelius.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s something to be said too of Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s contributions to the piano repertoire. None of The Five are remembered for producing significant works for the piano, and probably rightfully so, since they were overshadowed by the output of Chopin and the Germans. Tchaikovsky put the Russians on the map with the first piano concerto, but the phrase \u0026ldquo;Russian piano music\u0026rdquo; probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mean much today if not for the arrival of Rachmaninoff and Scriabin on the scene. Four piano concertos, plus etudes, suites, and preludes, all of them actively performed today.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot more to the man that could be mentioned in this context — his craft in melody and thematic variation, personal themes, the oft forgotten fact that he was a true and wholly successful conductor-composer-pianist — but I\u0026rsquo;ll stop here before I get ahead of myself.

(May want to turn up your sound.)\nRachmaninoff, The Rock (opening)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s magical, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? I\u0026rsquo;m really at a loss to describe it any other way. It\u0026rsquo;s as if you\u0026rsquo;re standing atop a cliff overlooking the ocean, peering into a mass of storm clouds brewing off in the distance, when suddenly out of the corner of your eye you catch a glimpse of sunlight starting to filter its way down through a small gap in the clouds. Horn II, entering on middle C, captures that initial feeling of wonder and bewilderment. When Horn I echoes an octave higher, the feeling is similar, but carries with it the excitement of a warranted suspicion or curiosity.\nThe excerpt is from the opening of Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s fantasia for orchestra, The Rock, Op. 7. The lower strings (omitted in the image) and bassoons suggest E major as the home key, so C-natural (or enharmonically, B-sharp) is our raised fifth. The flute too follows the contours of an E major scale, but picks up a B-sharp/C-natural or two along the way.\nPerhaps the effectiveness of the raised fifth lies in the fact that it forms an augmented triad sitting squarely between the tonic and its relative minor. In the above passage for instance, the tremolo in the violins below the flute line oscillates steadily between B-natural and C-sharp, necessarily visiting C-natural along the way, and as a result, creating a conflation of E major and C-sharp minor over the course of the phrase. Actually a pretty common pattern in tonal music.\nRaising the dominant pitch or lowering the sixth, almost surreptitiously like this, is a device that shows up pretty often in modern film music too, in order to achieve an effect similar to what I tried to describe with my terrible sunlight-through-the-clouds metaphor. At the very end of John Powell\u0026rsquo;s score to X-Men: The Last Stand, a trombone can be heard voicing an F-natural just as the rest of the orchestra settles into an A major chord. Listen for it at around 0:18-0:21, just before the suspended cymbal washes over everything (might be loud if you had your speakers turned up for The Rock).\nJohn Powell, X-Men: The Last Stand (end credits)\nAs a result of mulling over this idea in my head, I\u0026rsquo;m starting to hear it more and more in a lot of other pieces: Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s Spring cantata and John Knowles Paine\u0026rsquo;s overture to As You Like It, to name a few. I\u0026rsquo;d like to revisit those pieces in this context some time later. To be clear though, there\u0026rsquo;s a difference between overtly stating an augmented triad and just subtly sneaking in a raised fifth here and there. The former can be a discrete, indispensable stage in a harmonic progression; the latter is more of a musical device for adding or enhancing color.\n","permalink":"https://alexchao.github.io/posts/the-magical-raised-fifth-or-flat-six/","summary":"There\u0026rsquo;s something special about the fifth scale degree of the tonic (major) key when raised a half-step. Granted, there\u0026rsquo;s something special about every non-key pitch in a tonal system, but what really captivates me about the flat six is its affective power in a Romantic context. Take a minute to listen to this excerpt: what do you feel when you hear the horn make its solo entrance above the sustained bassoon and strings?","title":"The Magical Raised Fifth (or Flat Six)"},{"content":"The other day, I treated myself to the manuscript version of Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s fourth piano concerto, which I had never heard before. This version, dated sometime in late August of 1926, is the original version of the piece that the composer premiered that year, before revising it twice to cement what we know now as his fourth concerto.

Rachmaninoff notably revised his Second Piano Sonata (1913) in 1931, excising some fragments and condensing others significantly, but he left the general scheme of the work and its thematic material mostly intact. With the Second Symphony, he merely recommended, at least to my knowledge, several cuts and optional repeats.\nIf those alterations were deemed revisions, his changes to the fourth concerto in 1928 and finally in 1941 should be considered almost a complete rewrite. In fact, the finale was mostly rewritten, borrowing little from the original score and giving way to a much simpler form.\nA few weeks ago I wrote about a passage in the second subject of the final movement (1941 version) with a horn solo. I was surprised to find this passage entirely absent in the original, 1926 version.\nSecond subject from finale (1926)\nSecond subject from finale (1941)\nIn its place, the piano takes center stage with a familiar Dies Irae-inspired melody spelled out in thick, stepwise chords. The key of D-flat is still strongly suggested, but the horn is gone—which makes me sad—and there aren\u0026rsquo;t any voices in the orchestra that assume its role from the 1941 version, with either a soloistic line or pentatonic character. Instead, a solo trumpet and a choir of woodwinds chime in intermittently with supporting, motivic pronouncements.\nFollowing the second subject, a clarinet solo, entirely nonexistent in the 1941 version, marks the transition into the next set of themes. In fact, there are several places where Rachmaninoff has written solos into the manuscript score for instruments other than piano but has omitted them in the final version.\nClarinet solo from Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s Piano Concerto No. 4\nThis is all small change though. The most drastic difference in the manuscript version of the finale is the return of the second subject, adding at least two more minutes of music to the piece. For me, this restatement of some of the earlier themes rounds out the structure of the movement and I think results in a greater sense of resolution for listeners who, consciously or not, expect a sonata or rondo-like pattern.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s clear from looking at each work that exists as an original-revised pair that Rachmaninoff strove for greater economy in his music as he grew older. All his revised works are considerably shorter in length and got this way mostly through a paring down and simplification of the more complex passages. My feeling is that his revised editions are furnished with more \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; harmonic progressions and are condensed in the very spots where he had at first been the most verbose musically.\nAnd although he wasn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily enthusiastic about his first attempts, we as his audience receive works like this with fresh ears. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it makes sense to value one version objectively over the other, and I think most people would have a hard time making that kind of decision anyway when these two versions are, chiefly as works of art, so thoroughly constructed. The two are just telling snapshots of the same man at two different points in time.\nUnfortunately, that man was met with cold criticism for both versions of the piece. Following a New York performance of the first version on March 22, 1927, the music critic Pitts Sanborn wrote:\nThe concerto in question is an interminable, loosely knit hodgepodge of this and that, all the way from Liszt to Puccini, from Chopin to Tchaikovsky. Even Mendelssohn enjoys a passing compliment. The orchestra scoring has the richness of nougat and the piano part glitters with innumerable stock tricks and figurations. As music it is now weepily sentimental, now of an elfin prettiness, now swelling towards bombast in a fluent orotundity.\nSuch as it is, I rather enjoy the richness of nougat.\nSource: Bertensson, Sergei \u0026amp; Jay Leyda.

In If U Seek Amy, she sticks a B-flat into the tail end of the refrain, lowering the second scale degree a half-step and thereby giving the phrase a Phrygian-like modal inflection.\nFrom its beginning, the song clearly establishes A minor as the home key, though we don\u0026rsquo;t actually hear a B-natural until right before the refrain is first sung. As if to draw more attention to themselves too, the B-natural and B-flat both appear in a conspicuous rhythmic context: a three-against-two hemiola (i.e. three quarter notes overlaid on the third and fourth beats of the last measure, as depicted above).\nAnyway, the modern Phrygian mode is not so different from the natural minor (Aeolian) mode, as it differs only in the aforementioned second scale degree. And so it\u0026rsquo;s not completely jarring when at the end of this descending line one hears a pitch that does not belong to the tonic key. It\u0026rsquo;s like in the song 3, when Britney sings an A-natural instead of an A-flat (the third scale degree) to put the phrase momentarily in a major mode. The effect is mysterious. Furtive.

This was his least prolific period of composition, and as well the period that is vastly less popular with concert-goers. The concerto itself has neither the pianistic showmanship of the third nor the thematic inspiration of the second, while its melodic material is woven into some very unfamiliar harmonic language. For those won over by Vocalise and the 18th variation, it is either lackluster or all together alien.\nThe attacca entrance into the finale from the Largo movement is probably the most unsettling part of the piece. Although the orchestration is thin and delicate in this section, with individual voices appearing to chime in intermittently, it is chromatic, rhythmically irregular, and harmonically ambiguous. The inconstant articulations and nimble runs in the piano solo give the impression of a race lacking direction.\nBut Rachmaninoff is always going somewhere, always building towards something, even in moments of chaos like this. Very briefly, the music settles into G-flat major—the first suggestion we get of any tonal center. This is soon followed by the same material in E and a series of thick piano chords, moving in incremental progression towards a new tonal center. Upon finally arriving at the key of D-flat major, we are treated to an interlude that is conspicuously uncomplicated for the twenty minutes of music that came before it. The piano, plainly establishing the new key, clears a path for this simple melody in the horn:\nAnd again, moments later, with slight alteration:\nWhether you care for the dissonance and jazzy undertones of this piece, there is at least this one, shining moment of clarity. It is pure and simple in both structure and purpose. It consists almost entirely of quarter notes and half notes; it starts with a five-to-one pick-up; it is arch-like in shape; and it ends on the tonic. And as if simplicity in this form wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough, Rachmaninoff constructs this horn call using only the pentatonic scale—one of the most commonly occurring musical scales, and one with a significant place in the musical past of almost every culture in the world. It is a scale that is distinctly human.\nFor the duration of this passage and the Dies Irae-like melody that follows it, Rachmaninoff manages to suspend all musical unrest. He reverts to a sound that is both familiar and sincere, demonstrating that beauty need not derive from embellishment and complexity. In these few, short moments, with horn and piano in hushed dialogue, I am, as the listener, washed over with an overwhelming sense of resolution.\nFor me, this section of the concerto, which juxtaposes a palette of daring, new sounds with a humble nod to something more traditional, reveals the composer\u0026rsquo;s lifelong nostalgia. He was likely looking back to the music of his youth, but he also longed for his home in Russia, where, as an exile, he was no longer welcome.\n","permalink":"https://alexchao.github.io/posts/clarity-in-rachmaninoffs-fourth-concerto/","summary":"Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s fourth piano concerto is one of these works that, together with the third symphony and the Symphonic Dances, represents the last stage of the composer\u0026rsquo;s musical output.

Also present on that evening, as a member of the audience, was Sergei Prokofiev. He was 24 years old.\nAccording to the surviving press material that relates the outcome of this concert, Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s playing was not well received. As professional and musically gifted as the man was, his performance was apparently starved of the nuances that contemporary \u0026ldquo;Scriabinites\u0026rdquo; cherished in these pieces. And in fact, Rachmaninoff continued to endure criticism for his treatment of the late composer\u0026rsquo;s works as the season unfolded and as more critics throughout Russia were introduced to his interpretation. (If only we had such an opportunity.)\nProkofiev\u0026rsquo;s opinion went on record too, fortunately, and is less critical. In his account, he acknowledges the uproar of the press and the unmistakable novelty of Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s performance, but voices no immediate protests of his own.\nI tried to suggest an objective point of view: though we were accustomed to the composer\u0026rsquo;s interpretation, perhaps there are other ways of playing this work.\nHis coolheaded open-mindedness wouldn\u0026rsquo;t appease the older composer-pianist though, and what Prokofiev describes next is a first look at the unpleasant relationship they would share for the rest of their lives.\nEntering the artists\u0026rsquo; room, I continued my thought as I spoke to Rachmaninoff: \u0026ldquo;And yet, Sergei Vasilyevich, you played very well.\u0026rdquo; Rachmaninoff smiled acidly—\u0026ldquo;And you probably thought I\u0026rsquo;d play badly?\u0026rdquo; and he turned away to someone else. This put an end to our good relations. Some part in this was certainly contributed by Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s rejection of my music, and the irritation it provoked in him.\nAnd so, as history would have it, Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev would never really hit it off. I\u0026rsquo;d like to think that, as two of the most successful artists of their time, they at least shared a mutual respect for each other\u0026rsquo;s talent, but that probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have really mattered even if it were true. After the First World War, the two of them would advance their careers in music quite independently of each other, despite both of them leaving for the United States at around the same time. Before leaving Russia, however, the gods again arranged for these two men to be present together in a concert setting in Moscow. Rachmaninoff, together with his friend and fellow composer Medtner, attended a performance of Prokofiev\u0026rsquo;s chamber works. Prokofiev\u0026rsquo;s recollection of the evening confirms Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s generally mysterious and subdued demeanor:\nAmong those invited were Rachmaninoff and Medtner. Through the concert Medtner fumed and fussed, \u0026ldquo;If that\u0026rsquo;s music, I\u0026rsquo;m no musician.\u0026rdquo; Rachmaninoff, though, sat like a stone idol, and the Moscow audience, that usually received me well, was confused as it watched its hero\u0026rsquo;s reaction to my music.\nHow lucky we are to have such sensationalism on record. Actually, while these anecdotes mostly recount unpleasantness, there is another (a letter to a Moscow magazine) in which Prokofiev respectfully acknowledges Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s success in the concert hall. Still, there\u0026rsquo;s no denying the bad blood between these two; in a later discourse on his taste in music, Prokofiev dismissed the subject with the following:\nRachmaninoff—well, I\u0026rsquo;d rather say nothing about him. The truth is we hated each other\u0026rsquo;s guts!\nAll of this leaves me wondering whether it was Prokofiev the man or specifically his music that bothered Rachmaninoff so much. Either way, there isn\u0026rsquo;t much you can do, in general, to reconcile artistic differences. Prokofiev and others were on a path to a new kind of sound, and Rachmaninoff would simply have no part in it.\nSource: Bertensson \u0026amp; Leyda.

In particular, the 2009-2010 season has seen the symphonies of Tchaikovsky, Mahler, and Rachmaninoff, as well as a few other big names from the middle Romantic era. The piece from last night\u0026rsquo;s concert that motivated my purchase was Tchaikovsky\u0026rsquo;s violin concerto, performed by Christian Tetzlaff—a violinist of modest stature with a powerful sound. The performance generally matched my expectations of the piece, though Tetzlaff took the first movement cadenza and a few other passages at a much faster pace than most of the recordings I have heard. It didn\u0026rsquo;t, however, sound like a reading by Heifetz, who is praised (and occasionally criticized) in many an Amazon product review for his breakneck performance of this piece with Fritz Reiner conducting. To me, Heifetz was more scrupulous and calculated, if you will, about his articulations. Tetzlaff hammered through with unbridled verve. Despite the concerto being my initial reason for attending the concert, my experience was really sculpted by the other parts of the program, including a new work called Post-Scriptum by Victor Kissine, Ravel\u0026rsquo;s Valses nobles et sentimentales, and Liszt\u0026rsquo;s tone poem Tasso: Lamento e trionfo. The new work by Kissine saw its world premiere last night. The piece was somewhat tonal, but dissonant throughout, with every emerging trace of melodic clarity stamped out by percussive inquietude. There were more delicate moments too that brought forth the spirit of a horror movie, and in fact, there was at least one place in the piece where the bow of a contrabass was drawn vertically across the outer edge of a suspended cymbal to produce the same eerie squeal that you might hear in The Ring or F.E.A.R (yes, the video game). Apart from the time I played the Ma mère l\u0026rsquo;oye orchestral suite with PYMO, this was the first time I had heard an orchestral work by Ravel performed live. Not that I ever doubted it, but I now believe fully in the composer\u0026rsquo;s genius in orchestration, which is manifest only partially in even the best recordings. And recordings just don\u0026rsquo;t do justice to the truly jubilant (and utterly loud) moments in the Valses. As far as conductors go, MTT maintains a pretty conservative presence at the podium, but he still manages to generate a huge sound from his musicians. The tone poem by Liszt that closed the program reminded me of something I once read, regarding a tone poem by Tchaikovsky. At the time of this writing, the Wikipedia article on Tchaikovsky\u0026rsquo;s program work after Francesca Da Rimini mentions that its \u0026ldquo;swirling chromaticism\u0026rdquo; may suggest the influence of Liszt. Wherever this claim originated, it is likely that the author had Tasso: Lamento e trionfo in mind. Descending, chromatic motifs from this piece, as well as an overall, aggravated tone, are echoed frequently in Tchaikovsky\u0026rsquo;s piece. My predilection for the Russian composer\u0026rsquo;s style must have preempted my ability to digest Tasso though, as its capricious emotional landscape literally left me a little confused.\n","permalink":"https://alexchao.github.io/posts/san-francisco-symphony-march-5-2010/","summary":"I bought my tickets for last night\u0026rsquo;s concert with the San Francisco Symphony last fall when I was under the spell of an almost child-like excitement over this season\u0026rsquo;s programming of popular masterworks.

Brahms might be worth mentioning too, had he left us more than four to choose from.\nHowever, while there are countless recordings of these symphonies on the market, I think we\u0026rsquo;ve all grown accustomed to hearing a certain kind of Tchaikovsky. That is, few times have my ears ever been challenged by a noticeably divergent interpretation of these pieces. A fifteen minute first movement of the fifth symphony, for example, is standard fare.\nOr at least this was the case it seemed until I discovered the recordings of these symphonies performed by Romanian conductor Sergui Celibidache with the Munich Philharmonic. There are certainly a few things that make these recordings special, but the first thing I\u0026rsquo;ll mention is the most obvious: the track lengths listed on the back of each album case immediately indicate just how slow he takes these pieces. His recorded performance of the fourth symphony, for example, lasts a staggering 56′25″. The only other recording (that I know of) that even comes remotely close to this is Leonard Bernstein\u0026rsquo;s recording with the New York Philharmonic, clocking in at roughly 48 minutes.\nBut of course, raw length doesn\u0026rsquo;t say much about any performance beyond vaguely describing the tempo. In fact, while it may be common to apply a deliberate slowness to Tchaikovsky\u0026rsquo;s music for gross emotional flavoring, this probably wasn\u0026rsquo;t Celibidache\u0026rsquo;s intent. The late conductor\u0026rsquo;s son explains his father\u0026rsquo;s philosophy:\nAccording to my father, the tempo of a specific piece is not given by a metronome number but depends much rather on other criteria in the score and on the acoustic of a hall. This tempo fluctuates according to the complexity of the notes and their epiphenomena. In short, more notes need more time to develop and return (to the ear). The richer the music, the slower the tempo.\nThis is a decidedly intellectual approach to performing music, but a fitting one for a conductor who committed to creating unique, enriching experiences for himself, the musicians, and the audience. Unfortunately, the intricacies are mostly lost in the translation of real sound to electrical signals for those of us forced to relive the event through iTunes. Celibidache likewise frowned sternly upon recorded music, believing it to be an encumbrance to one\u0026rsquo;s spontaneity and in general a watered-down, unflattering rendering of the total experience. These recordings were thus produced and released posthumously by his son.\nWhat we hear in these recordings is extremely passionate music, but I\u0026rsquo;m almost ashamed to say it given that this is simply the nature of Tchaikovsky\u0026rsquo;s music. Merely relaxing the tempo could not alone explain the effectiveness of Celibidache\u0026rsquo;s conducting, but I will say that the dauntingly lachrymose finale of the sixth symphony is especially effective at this pace.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll dispense with any attempt to qualitatively describe Celibidache\u0026rsquo;s performances in words; frankly, I\u0026rsquo;ve never been satisfied with any kind of language that attempts to communicate musical feeling (the kind you find in concert program notes, for example). It just sounds silly and overworked to me. I\u0026rsquo;ll simply recommend that you give at least one of these recordings a dedicated listen, uninterrupted, from beginning to end, and hopefully on a device with respectable audio capabilities (i.e. your laptop speakers won\u0026rsquo;t do). A conductor who didn\u0026rsquo;t believe in recorded music deserves at least that much.\n","permalink":"https://alexchao.github.io/posts/celibidaches-tchaikovsky/","summary":"Tchaikovsky\u0026rsquo;s last three symphonies are probably the most performed and recorded symphonies in existence. Other contenders include those of Beethoven, Mozart, and maybe Haydn by virtue of there being over a hundred of them, but the trinity that is Tchaikovsky\u0026rsquo;s four, five, and six delivers a sampling of Romanticism that has proven irresistible to popular taste.

Many composers, to take music as an example, have some kind of musical trademark. Some exhibit their signature flourishes subtly or almost imperceptibly, while others do us the convenience of posting a big, blinking, neon sign in the sky. At the moment, I\u0026rsquo;m starting to think that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot in the music of film composer James Horner that is big, blinking, and neon.\nDown-Arpeggiated Chord At first I though this element was synthesized, but after fooling around at the 88 for a bit, I realized that it\u0026rsquo;s most likely just an arpeggiated chord played with two hands in a downwards cascading fashion. Horner typically inserts this piano arpeggio in places where the upper strings are the only other active orchestral voices. Usually, juxtaposing a higher-register section of the orchestra with a low one (with nothing in between) effects a distant, expansive quality. Examples from his scores can be found in Deep Impact, The Perfect Storm, and Apollo 13.\nChimes There\u0026rsquo;s something about bells that evokes a sense of grand antiquity—a quality most likely born out of our familiarity with their pre-modern functions. Horner uses tubular bells (or chimes) in a number of different musical settings (from the charging of Fort Wagner in Glory to the to the tidal force of the sea in The Perfect Storm), but they achieve the same effect in each situation. Opinions will vary by the listener, but to me, the use of chimes lifts his music into a vast, limitless space where the sound floats freely, without bounds. This is appropriate given the types of films he has scored.\nThe Lydian Mode I haven\u0026rsquo;t exactly made a list of the places where I\u0026rsquo;ve heard Horner write with Lydian modality, but I think I\u0026rsquo;d be able to point it out in most of his major projects. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard the term before, you\u0026rsquo;ve at least heard the theme to The Simpsons, which hits some of the key pitches of a modern Lydian scale. In Apollo 13, Horner uses climbing Lydian scales in the violin section during the mission launch sequence, and the horn call that opens his score for the film Deep Impact, shown below, adheres to the Lydian mode on D (basically D major with the fourth scale degree raised a semitone).\nThe intervals that constitute a Lydian scale are close enough to those of an Ionian scale (the common major scale that your Western-classical-music-attuned ear loves to hear) that it isn\u0026rsquo;t as unsettling as some of the other modes. In fact, if you listen to this horn call, you\u0026rsquo;d probably find it very sonorous and calming.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s also partly because the French horn is awesome.\nAnyway, these are the three major elements that make James Horner\u0026rsquo;s music most recognizable to me, but I\u0026rsquo;d be remiss to leave it at that. While they are among the most easily discernible features of his compositional style, they aren\u0026rsquo;t the whole of it. An artist is many things, and the palpable elements are merely a vague manifestation of what\u0026rsquo;s really in the heart and soul.\nOh, and obviously, he isn\u0026rsquo;t the only composer using chimes, the Lydian mode, and piano thingamabobbers.\n","permalink":"https://alexchao.github.io/posts/james-horner-and-the-lydian-mode/","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s a curious thing how an artist who has reached a certain level of creative maturity becomes somewhat of a prisoner to idiosyncrasy.

Fact is, one name rarely ever surfaces without some mention of the other, and if you like music by one, chances are you also enjoy music by the other (convenient given the sheer number of classical albums that pair their works together).\nThe opinion inherent in their seeming inseparability is that their works demonstrate an uncanny gift for melody and emotional expression. On separate occasions in fact, I\u0026rsquo;ve heard their symphonies described as \u0026ldquo;dark and brooding\u0026rdquo;. This point of view by itself makes complete sense, and I would be the last to refute it, but it also suggests an idiomatic similarity between the two that obscures their basic differences. Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff were very much not the same composer at all. Admittedly, Tchaikovsky can be held partially responsible for the later composer\u0026rsquo;s general attitude towards composition, but stylistically, Rachmaninoff as a composer borrows from elsewhere (notably, The Five) and innovates plenty in his own right.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not really familiar with the full range of Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s true compositional influences (as there is, I think, a pianistic element in Liszt and Chopin that I know little about), but I\u0026rsquo;ve been starting to see some traces of the middle-Romantic, Russian school in his pieces. There is, for example, a foreshadowing of his idiom in Borodin\u0026rsquo;s tone poem In the Steppes of Central Asia (1880). In particular, two musical devices that feature prominently in Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s output make an almost overstated appearance in this piece: step-wise motion and counterpoint. (I admit, the former is less a device than it is just a fashion in which to craft harmony.)\nThe theme from Steppes above curiously derives its effectiveness from its excessive restatement of the same few pitches, over and over again. It wanders little more than a third from where it begins on the third scale degree, and yet by gradually teeter-tottering its way to the tonic, it manages to fill the expanse of some ten measures before finally coming to rest. Some thirty years later, the themes and opening clarinet solo of the adagio movement from Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s 2nd symphony echo this pattern.\nBoth works also make heavy use of counterpoint, though most likely for different reasons. Borodin wrote this tone poem to depict an encounter between travelers on the Caucasus of eastern Europe, and arranging several melodies in counterpoint is how he simply makes musical sense of this scene and the commotion of the caravans. As for Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s symphony, one can never be really sure of why a composer uses a particular device if no clear program is known, other than because he likes the way it sounds or because it is simply in his style. In this case, we know that Rachmaninoff was a gifted artist in contrapuntal writing and that it interested him enough to employ it widely. After all, he did have, if only briefly, the illustrious Taneyev as a pedagogue in said discipline.\nOf course, anytime we perceive the influence of one artist on another, we can\u0026rsquo;t be certain that the inspiration was conscious. In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s usually not. I think there\u0026rsquo;s more evidence to suggest that the traces of Russian Romanticism that made it into Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s music resulted implicitly from the nuances of his education at the conservatory in Moscow and his exposure to the great Russian masters while they were still alive during his youth.\nBecause of this influence, I sometimes think of Rachmaninoff as the culmination of all the Russian tradition that came before him, but his melodies don\u0026rsquo;t carry as much of the eastern—or sometimes deemed \u0026ldquo;oriental\u0026rdquo;—tinge of, say, Borodin\u0026rsquo;s large-scale orchestral works or Rimsky-Korsakov\u0026rsquo;s Scheherazade. Whatever the case, we know from his memoirs of the great respect he held for his predecessors and of the pain he suffered as an exile from his home country. These sentiments, together with his staunch devotion to capturing beauty through emotion in music, confirm his standing as a truly Russian composer.\n","permalink":"https://alexchao.github.io/posts/russian-steppes/","summary":"From a distance, Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky look much the same.

We sang a number of hymns and psalms, and our director would often select a small group of us to sing a descant — known to me then only as an aria-like soprano part above the rest of the choir. It forced us to exercise the upper range of our voices and was very unforgiving of even the slightest deviations in pitch. It was sung entirely on the syllable \u0026ldquo;ah\u0026rdquo; and, as I remember it, committed to being neither a central nor merely peripheral voice in the choir.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve developed a fondness for most anything resembling a descant now because of the way they transform the roles of the other voices in a piece. They are ornamental, but you can also fixate on them, since they are, by definition, counter-melodies. Traditionally, I think the term has ecclesiastic roots in hymnal music, but it has come into use to generally denote a counter-melody above and removed from the other voices.\nIn a choral setting, a few sopranos seem to be the natural choice for a descant part. In the symphony orchestra though, the choice depends on what makes sense from the standpoint of orchestral color and texture. In a passage dominated by woodwinds for example, I think the clarinet makes a terrific descant instrument, for reasons that are more or less subjective.\nIn a tutti section, the descant role is more demanding. A woodwind instrument will not carry enough sound. Twenty violins can produce the sound, but in Western classical, Romantic music, chances are the composer has charged the upper strings with the melody. I also feel that we have been conditioned to hear violins en masse as heralds of melody, so to avoid confusion, we best not afford them the part.\nEnter the horn.\nThe idea of the horn behaving as a descant instrument occurred to me recently as I was listening to Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s Symphony No. 2 (though the very existence of descant horns may also have had something to do with it). The opening movement, an expanded sonata form movement, is an exercise in counterpoint and a testament to the composer\u0026rsquo;s expertise thereof. In the second group of the exposition, the first and second violins carry the melody in octaves, but they are accompanied by one of my favorite instances of non-soloistic horn writing. I\u0026rsquo;ll let the parts speak for themselves: There\u0026rsquo;s something about the horn in its upper range that gives it a distant and suspended quality that is free of the edginess with which brass sometimes are (unjustly) associated. Actually, this is the reason why the solitary horn call is in general so haunting and such an effective orchestral element. Though Rachmaninoff voices this particular passage for the whole horn section, it is dominated by the counter-melody in the first and third horns, which moves decidedly when the melody does not. Parts of it have an unambiguous arch to them, and the overall shape of the line is defined by gradual, step-wise motion.\nThe emotionality inherent in this passage is really beyond my words. Give it a listen if you have the chance.\nThere are a few other examples from Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s oeuvre that I\u0026rsquo;ve been entertaining in the back of my mind. The most obvious to me is a conspicuously optimistic interlude early on in the third movement of his fourth concerto, where the first horn ascends and gradually descends a D-flat major pentatonic scale. There are also fleeting moments in his choral symphony The Bells and in his baritone cantata Spring where the horn assumes a descant-like role, albeit with less interesting parts (in some cases, just a well placed, sustained pitch).\nThis is what imbues Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s music with an aesthetic that I\u0026rsquo;m at a loss to describe as anything but heavenly. Composers of the Romantic period all wrote soulful tunes and melodies for the classical radio, but few captured an emotional palette as complex as Rachmaninoff\u0026rsquo;s orchestral coloring. A unifying characteristic of these descant-like moments is that many of them signify release or resolution after a swell of harmonic ambiguity or even cacophony — a musical eye-of-the-storm in some contexts or, in others, just a momentary repose.\nTo me, these are moments that communicate a sense of serenity and clarity, which, given the modern, post-Romantic, serialist landscape in which they were conceived, is refreshing.\n","permalink":"https://alexchao.github.io/posts/the-horn-as-orchestral-descant/","summary":"The term descant hearkens back to my youth as a choir boy, when my musical experiences were dominated by music of the church.
