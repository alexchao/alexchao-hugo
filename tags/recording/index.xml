      <description>Tchaikovsky&amp;rsquo;s last three symphonies are probably the most performed and recorded symphonies in existence.Â Other contenders include those of Beethoven, Mozart, and maybe Haydn by virtue of there being over a hundred of them, but the trinity that is Tchaikovsky&amp;rsquo;s four, five, and six delivers a sampling of Romanticism that has proven irresistible to popular taste. Brahms might be worth mentioning too, had he left us more than four to choose from.</description>
