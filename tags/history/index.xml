Happy New Year! Yay to beautiful melodies (and descending cascades of Etudes!)</description></item><item><title>Just Add Orchestra</title><link>https://alexchao.github.io/posts/just-add-orchestra/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2011 05:40:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexchao.github.io/posts/just-add-orchestra/</guid><description>The No. 3 (C-minor) etude from Rachmaninoff&amp;rsquo;s first set of Ã‰tudes-Tableaux, Op. 33 was omitted from the original publication and released posthumously. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read anything that explains why, but it probably has something to do with one of its melodies making an appearance in his fourth piano concerto, written some fifteen years later.

The portrait painted by this &amp;ldquo;Best Of&amp;rdquo; compilation is of a man who procured steadfast melodies and unrelenting sentimentality till the day he died. Beyond these works too, you won&amp;rsquo;t find much that deviates from this pattern. Relatively speaking, he didn&amp;rsquo;t have eras or periods of stylistic evolution like, say, Stravinsky.</description></item></channel></rss>
