The music in this first iteration reveals a strikingly unfamiliar side of the composer.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/happy-shostakovich/ class="link black dim">A Happy Shostakovich</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;ve been tired and uninspired lately, so I will just take a moment to rattle off some thoughts about Shostakovich&rsquo;s Piano Concerto No. 2 in F. Feel like I could give the Romantic era business a rest anyway.
Our good friend Dmitri wrote a bunch of brooding, controversial symphonies, but in this concerto, there is a nice slice of his more cheerful side, as can be found too in the Festive Overture and ninth symphony.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/clarity-in-rachmaninoffs-fourth-concerto/ class="link black dim">Clarity in Rachmaninoff's Fourth Concerto</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s fourth piano concerto is one of these works that, together with the third symphony and the Symphonic Dances, represents the last stage of the composer&rsquo;s musical output. This was his least prolific period of composition, and as well the period that is vastly less popular with concert-goers. The concerto itself has neither the pianistic showmanship of the third nor the thematic inspiration of the second, while its melodic material is woven into some very unfamiliar harmonic language.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/san-francisco-symphony-march-5-2010/ class="link black dim">San Francisco Symphony (March 5, 2010)</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I bought my tickets for last night&rsquo;s concert with the San Francisco Symphony last fall when I was under the spell of an almost child-like excitement over this season&rsquo;s programming of popular masterworks. In particular, the 2009-2010 season has seen the symphonies of Tchaikovsky, Mahler, and Rachmaninoff, as well as a few other big names from the middle Romantic era.

Still, I like to think about the significance of a musical work coming into existence, to fill an ethereal space where once there existed a musical void. Before November 28th, 1909, no one knew what the third concerto by Rachmaninoff sounded like, save the composer himself.</div></div></div></div></section></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://alexchao.github.io/>&copy; Alex Chao 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
