My advice to you is to write. Your writing doesn&rsquo;t need to have a specific structure, and you don&rsquo;t have to write for a specific audience, but getting your ideas down on paper is a service you can render to your future self.

Your writing doesn&rsquo;t need to have a specific structure, and you don&rsquo;t have to write for a specific audience, but getting your ideas down on paper is a service you can render to your future self. The important thing is to write with some regularity, even if not often. Find a way to make it easy for you to write, so that you never have an excuse not to write. Use a small notepad, a blog, or something like notion.so.</p><p>Actually though, any hobby — however casual — that requires you to produce a &ldquo;tangible&rdquo; product of some kind (a document, a video, an audio file, an image, etc.) will fit the bill. There&rsquo;s something really rewarding about looking back at the things you&rsquo;ve produced and observing the progression over time.</p><p>I guess what I&rsquo;m recommending is that you periodically project snapshots of your brain into the world through creative expression.</p><p>Good luck, man.</p></blockquote></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center p-6 pr-3 no-underline" href=https://alexchao.github.io/posts/quarantine-likes-dislikes/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Quarantine Likes & Dislikes</span></a>
