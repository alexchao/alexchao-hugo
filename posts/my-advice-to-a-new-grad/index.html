My advice to you is to write. Your writing doesn&rsquo;t need to have a specific structure, and you don&rsquo;t have to write for a specific audience, but getting your ideas down on paper is a service you can render to your future self. The important thing is to write with some regularity, even if not often."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.104.0"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><meta property="og:title" content="My Advice to a New Grad"><meta property="og:description" content="I was asked recently to provide advice to a new college grad.

Here is the core of what I wrote.</p><blockquote><p>My advice to you is to write. Your writing doesn&rsquo;t need to have a specific structure, and you don&rsquo;t have to write for a specific audience, but getting your ideas down on paper is a service you can render to your future self. The important thing is to write with some regularity, even if not often. Find a way to make it easy for you to write, so that you never have an excuse not to write. Use a small notepad, a blog, or something like notion.so.</p><p>Actually though, any hobby — however casual — that requires you to produce a &ldquo;tangible&rdquo; product of some kind (a document, a video, an audio file, an image, etc.) will fit the bill. There&rsquo;s something really rewarding about looking back at the things you&rsquo;ve produced and observing the progression over time.</p><p>I guess what I&rsquo;m recommending is that you periodically project snapshots of your brain into the world through creative expression.</p><p>Good luck, man.</p></blockquote><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://alexchao.github.io/>&copy; Alex Chao 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
