The music in this first iteration reveals a strikingly unfamiliar side of the composer.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/britney-spears-breaking-the-mold/ class="link black dim">Britney Spears, Breaking the Mold</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;d say that I probably enjoy about half of the songs on the radio today.

I don&rsquo;t think I can easily describe what&rsquo;s in my tastes, but in general, most of the songs I like capitalize on the ever-popular I-V-vi-IV or i-VI-III-VII chord progressions somewhere in the chorus or refrain (e.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/the-horn-trill-in-dvoraks-8th-symphony/ class="link black dim">The Horn Trill in Dvorak's 8th Symphony</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Following in the steps of my last post, here&rsquo;s another nifty little eight bar passage—this one from the finale of Dvorak&rsquo;s Symphony No. 8 in G, featuring the principal and second horns. The movement opens with a modest trumpet fanfare introducing a series of pastoral variations in the strings, but then it&rsquo;s off to the races at rehearsal letter C when Dvorak calls upon the entire ensemble to repeat the main theme.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/happy-shostakovich/ class="link black dim">A Happy Shostakovich</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;ve been tired and uninspired lately, so I will just take a moment to rattle off some thoughts about Shostakovich&rsquo;s Piano Concerto No. 2 in F. Feel like I could give the Romantic era business a rest anyway.
Our good friend Dmitri wrote a bunch of brooding, controversial symphonies, but in this concerto, there is a nice slice of his more cheerful side, as can be found too in the Festive Overture and ninth symphony.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/sibelius-on-the-piano/ class="link black dim">Sibelius on the Piano</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The piano seems like such an integral part of every classical composer&rsquo;s output, if not as a vehicle for masterworks, then as a platform for experimentation. And we may take it for granted sometimes, but it is truly the ultimate musical tool. Not only can it sound multiple, simultaneous pitches (something that is difficult or even impossible on other instruments), it also provides a very natural interface for its operator. Forget embouchures or slide or bowing positions; as a pianist, you sit before a neatly arranged array of keys, each corresponding to one of the eighty-eight pitches you care most about.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/clarity-in-rachmaninoffs-fourth-concerto/ class="link black dim">Clarity in Rachmaninoff's Fourth Concerto</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s fourth piano concerto is one of these works that, together with the third symphony and the Symphonic Dances, represents the last stage of the composer&rsquo;s musical output. This was his least prolific period of composition, and as well the period that is vastly less popular with concert-goers. The concerto itself has neither the pianistic showmanship of the third nor the thematic inspiration of the second, while its melodic material is woven into some very unfamiliar harmonic language.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/rachmaninoff-and-prokofiev/ class="link black dim">Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">On the 18th of November, 1915, a recital was held in Moscow to commemorate the life of Alexander Scriabin, whose premature death in April of that year had rocked the world of Russian music. The program consisted entirely of his own works, and performing them at the piano was fellow Moscow Conservatory graduate, Sergei Rachmaninoff. Also present on that evening, as a member of the audience, was Sergei Prokofiev. He was 24 years old.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/san-francisco-symphony-march-5-2010/ class="link black dim">San Francisco Symphony (March 5, 2010)</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I bought my tickets for last night&rsquo;s concert with the San Francisco Symphony last fall when I was under the spell of an almost child-like excitement over this season&rsquo;s programming of popular masterworks. In particular, the 2009-2010 season has seen the symphonies of Tchaikovsky, Mahler, and Rachmaninoff, as well as a few other big names from the middle Romantic era.

Brahms might be worth mentioning too, had he left us more than four to choose from.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/dear-ms-wang/ class="link black dim">Dear Ms. Wang</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Out of a mostly irrational desire to witness two musical greats synergized in one absolutely fantastic display of awesomeness, I&rsquo;d like to see Yuja Wang perform Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s sonata. The second one of course. The first one is great too, but let&rsquo;s face it, for a girl who professes a love for those lyrical, big, romantic pieces, Mlle. Wang can&rsquo;t go wrong with Op. 36. And with Chopin&rsquo;s second already under her belt, I&rsquo;d only find it in the natural order of things.</div></div></div></div></section><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/ aria-label=First class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/3/ aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/ aria-label="Page 1" class=page-link role=button>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/2/ aria-label="Page 2" class=page-link role=button>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/3/ aria-label="Page 3" class=page-link role=button>3</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 4" class=page-link role=button>4</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/5/ aria-label="Page 5" class=page-link role=button>5</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/5/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/5/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://alexchao.github.io/>&copy; Alex Chao 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
