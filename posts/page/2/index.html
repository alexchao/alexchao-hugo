Apart from my not having many connections in the choral community, a full chorus would probably outnumber the students and parents in attendance at the recital.
As a fallback, I hastily mixed a synthesized rendition of the hymn for horn choir. I owe this exercise to GarageBand for having an impressive horn ensemble sample in its sound library, but I was happy enough with the results to take the time to &ldquo;write out&rdquo; (in Sibelius) the score for a 5-part horn choir.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/finding-the-right-words/ class="link black dim">Finding the Right Words</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">My recent predilection for liturgical music has given rise to what ought to be my first choral work.

I have given myself the rather daunting task of trying to capture the same spiritual flavor of these works, while omitting any religious program (that is, for some definition of &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo;).</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/south-bay-horn-day-2015/ class="link black dim">South Bay Horn Day 2015</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This past Saturday, I attended South Bay Horn Day at Mountain View High School.

I&rsquo;m not really sure how it happened, but I guess I was in the throes of a more&mldr; hormonal phase of music. It was a concerning thing to be getting away from my classical predilections, but corrective measures weren&rsquo;t something that could be forced.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/discovering-arnold-bax/ class="link black dim">Discovering Arnold Bax</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">On my flight to Thailand in December, the in-flight entertainment console at my seat was playing as background music a piece by English composer Arnold Bax. I hadn&rsquo;t heard of Bax before, and as I sat there browsing the Action & Adventure category of movie selections, I stopped to take note of the piece&rsquo;s harmonic language and use of orchestral color. It was exactly the kind of early 20th century writing that I&rsquo;ve come to love and obsessively seek out.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/learning-to-self-publish/ class="link black dim">Learning to Self-Publish</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">For not terribly compelling reasons, I am trying to get my score for My Name is Richard Rozen printed and published semi-professionally.
