The one passage that caught my attention opens Part II of the ballet—a scene that depicts a camp of pirates cavorting at night in a savage, sabbath-like dance.</p><p><a href=https://alexchao-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/07/7a72a-ravel-daphnis_et_chloe-interlude.mp3 title="Ravel, Daphnis et Chloe">Ravel, Daphnis et Chloe</a></p><p><a href=https://alexchao-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/07/989fc-mcneely-sote-xizors_palace.mp3 title="Joel McNeely, Shadows of the Empire">Joel McNeely, Shadows of the Empire</a></p><p>The familiarity was enough to make me immediately drop whatever it was that I was doing and fire off a Google search for &ldquo;joel mcneely daphnis&rdquo;, which turned up a <a href="http://forums.ffshrine.org/showthread.php?p=1267435" title="FFShrine forum, Joel McNeely">forum thread</a> in which one user points out that McNeely derived his music for <em>Shadows of the Empire</em> from two works: Ravel&rsquo;s ballet and another, <em>The Quest</em>, by British composer William Walton.</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to explore the Walton suggestion a little bit more, but I&rsquo;m more curious to know whether there exists any verbal or written acknowledgment from McNeely (<strong>EDIT</strong>: some does exist <a href=http://www.underscores.fr/index.php/2009/10/interview-joel-mc-neely-vo/ title="Interview with Joel McNeely">in an interview</a>). I mean, presumably, this kind of creative &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; happens all the time, but artists don&rsquo;t always call attention to their sources of inspiration unless prompted. In fact, the aforementioned forum user speaks to the matter as if McNeely stole the material from Ravel. I&rsquo;d have to give this Walton ballet a listen to verify that claim.</p><p><strong>EDIT (March 2017)</strong>: updated to refer to SOTE as a &ldquo;media event.&rdquo; Thanks Espen!</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/film-score/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">film score</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/the-magical-raised-fifth-or-flat-six/>The Magical Raised Fifth (or Flat Six)</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/james-horner-and-the-lydian-mode/>James Horner and the Lydian Mode</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://alexchao.github.io/>&copy; Alex Chao 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
