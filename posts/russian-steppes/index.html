There is, for example, a foreshadowing of his idiom in Borodin’s tone poem In the Steppes of Central Asia (1880). In particular, two musical devices that feature prominently in Rachmaninoff’s output make an almost overstated appearance in this piece: step-wise motion and counterpoint. (I admit, the former is less a device than it is just a fashion in which to craft harmony.)
