It&rsquo;s not finished, but with it, I have tried to produce a hymn in the style of Romantic-era musical settings of Russian orthodox worship services. I have given myself the rather daunting task of trying to capture the same spiritual flavor of these works, while omitting any religious program (that is, for some definition of &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo;). I&rsquo;ve written the piece for <em>a cappella</em> SATBB chorus, and it&rsquo;s looking to be about three minutes long.</p><p>At the moment, I&rsquo;m in the process of deciding on a text for the work, which is a process so critical and yet unbounded as to be basically paralyzing. My first experiments in assigning words to the music have involved a <a href=http://www.veterans.gc.ca/fra/remembrance/get-involved/remembrance-day/guide-to-commemorative-services>French adaptation</a> of a poem <em>For the Fallen</em> by Robert Laurence Binyon (1869-1943).</p><p>More on my aspirations for this piece later.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://alexchao.github.io/>&copy; Alex Chao 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
