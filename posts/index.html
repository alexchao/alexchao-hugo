While wandering around in London&rsquo;s Piccadilly Circus neighborhood, I stumbled upon what I later learned to be the National Animal Rights March. A sizable gathering of colorful and impassioned people, young and old, were marching down the street with signs and banners, advocating greater sensibilities for the treatment of animals and a wholesale prohibition on the consumption of animal meat.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/when-to-write-code-comments/ class="link black dim">When to Write Code Comments</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Generally speaking, my advice on this topic would be:
Don&rsquo;t write comments to describe what the code is doing.
Code written in an imperative way can be read line by line to determine what processing is being performed. Re-stating the logic or steps of execution in a comment runs the risk of the comment falling out of sync with the code and becoming outdated.
If a section of imperative code gets big, unwieldy, and hard to read, that&rsquo;s probably a sign that a refactoring is needed and some abstractions need to be introduced.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/quarantine-likes-dislikes/ class="link black dim">Quarantine Likes & Dislikes</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">In quarantine, I like:
Having an easy &ldquo;out&rdquo; from social obligations. Not having to bother buying or preparing food for myself. Alone time. Generally, not having to be anywhere at any particular time. I dislike:
Any food I do get isn&rsquo;t quite hot enough. No physical exercise. No dance parties (actual dance parties, like with a DJ and fabulous people). Not being able to hang out with my close friends.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/my-advice-to-a-new-grad/ class="link black dim">My Advice to a New Grad</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I was asked recently to provide advice to a new college grad. Here is the core of what I wrote.
My advice to you is to write. Your writing doesn&rsquo;t need to have a specific structure, and you don&rsquo;t have to write for a specific audience, but getting your ideas down on paper is a service you can render to your future self. The important thing is to write with some regularity, even if not often.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/on-the-extinction-of-animal-species/ class="link black dim">On the Extinction of Animal Species</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I’ve been reading Noah Yuval Harari’s Sapiens and have reached the chapter in the book where he tells of the profound impact that the Agricultural Revolution of our species had on ourselves and on the planet. In basic terms, the Agricultural Revolution was the period a little over 10,000 years ago when our species very gradually made the transition from subsisting as foragers and hunter-gatherers to settling down as farmers, living in settlements and villages with accompanying fields of domesticated crops and cattle.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/steven-pinker-and-sam-harris-at-the-dolby-theatre/ class="link black dim">Steven Pinker and Sam Harris at the Dolby Theatre</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">On March 14, I went to see the launch event of Sam Harris&rsquo;s Waking Up Book Club, where he and Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker shared the stage at the Dolby Theatre to discuss Pinker&rsquo;s new book Enlightenment Now and a range of philosophical topics. Among the things they touched on were science, humanism, politics, and artificial intelligence. About halfway into their conversation, Sam prompted Pinker to speak about the rise of the alt-right.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/south-bay-horn-day-2017/ class="link black dim">South Bay Horn Day 2017</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This weekend, I attended South Bay Horn Day 2017 where I was reunited with my teacher and friend, Daniel Wood. As he announced at the end of the evening concert program, this happened to be his last year at the helm of the South Bay Horn Day event, with no one as of yet having stepped up to take the reins. The event has run for six consecutive years, and in that time has built some great relationships among the network of horn players in the Bay Area, while also offering an environment in which some really beautiful musical moments have been crafted.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/symphonies-in-my-head/ class="link black dim">Symphonies in My Head</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A symphony really doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be delivered to its audience through the copper filament of a pair of headphones. For all the labor that goes into a 40-minute work (both in composition and preparation on the part of the ensemble) that sees its finer details realized at the hands and lungs of sixty-some-odd musicians, it&rsquo;s really a disservice to have the sound injected directly into one&rsquo;s head cavity. It is not possible to really experience a &ldquo;wall of sound&rdquo; when the sound begins and ends as a whisper from a mere earbud.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/discovering-barbershop/ class="link black dim">Discovering Barbershop</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Singing in a boys choir when I was younger and later singing with my high school chorus, there were few opportunities to perform a cappella music. A cappella frequently emerged in rehearsals as an ear-training exercise, but it wasn&rsquo;t till I encountered what seemed to be an army of a cappella singers and groups in college that I got my first, real taste of the form. As a freshman, I auditioned for a bass opening in Cornell University&rsquo;s Last Call, but after not getting the part, I more or less abandoned a cappella for other pursuits.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/%E4%BA%8C%E8%83%A1/ class="link black dim">二胡</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">First order of business: I am living in Taiwan (since August 19th). I am taking an 二胡 (èrhú) class, and thus far have learned the basics of bowing. The proper grip and bow placement is tricky, and having never played a string instrument, the entire experience is foreign to me. In the first two lessons, none of my previous musical training has volunteered itself to be of any use, and the class is furthermore taught entirely in Chinese, so you know, there&rsquo;s that.</div></div></div></div></section><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class="page-item disabled"><a aria-disabled=true aria-label=First class=page-link role=button tabindex=-1><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><a aria-disabled=true aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button tabindex=-1><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 1" class=page-link role=button>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/2/ aria-label="Page 2" class=page-link role=button>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/3/ aria-label="Page 3" class=page-link role=button>3</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/4/ aria-label="Page 4" class=page-link role=button>4</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/5/ aria-label="Page 5" class=page-link role=button>5</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/2/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/5/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://alexchao.github.io/>&copy; Alex Chao 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
