For a symphony written in the 1960&rsquo;s, it summons a Romantic spirit worthy of Tchaikovsky. Particularly <a href=http://www.overgrownpath.com/2010/12/if-you-like-mahler-and-who-doesnt-try.html title="If you like Mahler">if you like Mahler</a>, you&rsquo;ll certainly enjoy the <em>Andante con moto</em> and its resemblance to Mahler&rsquo;s adagio movement from the same-numbered symphony. Overt sentimentality of this kind reminds us that 20th century composers frequently found work as film composers.</p><p>The theme makes a brilliant return in the finale, but the work ends silently, meandering an unnerving distance away from the tonic. I guess harmonic resolution really just wasn&rsquo;t the thing to do in those days.</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/symphony/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">symphony</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/the-horn-trill-in-dvoraks-8th-symphony/>The Horn Trill in Dvorak's 8th Symphony</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/the-horn-as-orchestral-descant/>The Horn as Orchestral Descant</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://alexchao.github.io/>&copy; Alex Chao 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
