For a symphony written in the 1960&rsquo;s, it summons a Romantic spirit worthy of Tchaikovsky. Particularly <a href=http://www.overgrownpath.com/2010/12/if-you-like-mahler-and-who-doesnt-try.html title="If you like Mahler">if you like Mahler</a>, you&rsquo;ll certainly enjoy the <em>Andante con moto</em> and its resemblance to Mahler&rsquo;s adagio movement from the same-numbered symphony. Overt sentimentality of this kind reminds us that 20th century composers frequently found work as film composers.</p><p>The theme makes a brilliant return in the finale, but the work ends silently, meandering an unnerving distance away from the tonic. I guess harmonic resolution really just wasn&rsquo;t the thing to do in those days.</p></section><footer class="mt-12 flex flex-wrap"><a class="mr-1.5 mb-1.5 rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] px-5 py-2 no-underline dark:bg-white/[8%]" href=https://alexchao.github.io/tags/symphony>symphony</a></footer><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2 items-center p-6 pr-3 no-underline" href=https://alexchao.github.io/posts/just-add-orchestra/><span class=mr-1.5>←</span><span>Just Add Orchestra</span></a>
