[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_292&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;500&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Christian Tetzlaff (alexandra-vosding.de)&rdquo;]<a href=http://www.christiantetzlaff.com/index_en.html><img src=https://alexchaocom.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/a2e8a-christiantetzlaff.jpg alt="Christian Tetzlaff" title="Christian Tetzlaff"></a>[/caption] The piece from last night&rsquo;s concert that motivated my purchase was <strong>Tchaikovsky</strong>&rsquo;s violin concerto, performed by <em>Christian Tetzlaff</em>—a violinist of modest stature with a powerful sound.  The performance generally matched my expectations of the piece, though Tetzlaff took the first movement cadenza and a few other passages at a much faster pace than most of the recordings I have heard.  It didn&rsquo;t, however, sound like <a href=http://www.lala.com/#album/504684633539769990 title="Heifetz plays Tchaikovsky">a reading by Heifetz</a>, who is praised (and occasionally criticized) in many an Amazon product review for his breakneck performance of this piece with Fritz Reiner conducting.  To me, Heifetz was more scrupulous and calculated, if you will, about his articulations.  Tetzlaff hammered through with unbridled verve. Despite the concerto being my initial reason for attending the concert, my experience was really sculpted by the other parts of the program, including a new work called <em>Post-Scriptum</em> by Victor Kissine, Ravel&rsquo;s <em>Valses nobles et sentimentales</em>, and Liszt&rsquo;s tone poem <em>Tasso: Lamento e trionfo</em>. The new work by <strong>Kissine</strong> saw its world premiere last night.  The piece was somewhat tonal, but dissonant throughout, with every emerging trace of melodic clarity stamped out by percussive inquietude.  There were more delicate moments too that brought forth the spirit of a horror movie, and in fact, there was at least one place in the piece where the bow of a contrabass was drawn vertically across the outer edge of a suspended cymbal to produce the same eerie squeal that you might hear in <em>The Ring</em> or <em>F.E.A.R</em> (yes, <a href=http://www.whatisfear.com/ title=F.E.A.R.>the video game</a>).

Not that I ever doubted it, but I now believe fully in the composer&rsquo;s genius in orchestration, which is manifest only partially in even the best recordings. And recordings just don&rsquo;t do justice to the truly jubilant (and utterly loud) moments in the <em>Valses.</em> As far as conductors go, <a href=http://www.michaeltilsonthomas.com/ title="Michael Tilson Thomas">MTT</a> maintains a pretty conservative presence at the podium, but he still manages to generate a huge sound from his musicians. The tone poem by <strong>Liszt</strong> that closed the program reminded me of something I once read, regarding a tone poem by Tchaikovsky.  At the time of this writing, the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesca_da_Rimini_(Tchaikovsky) title="Francesca Da Rimini at Wikipedia">Wikipedia article</a> on Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s program work after <em>Francesca Da Rimini</em> mentions that its &ldquo;swirling chromaticism&rdquo; may suggest the influence of Liszt.  Wherever this claim originated, it is likely that the author had <em>Tasso: Lamento e trionfo</em> in mind.  Descending, chromatic motifs from this piece, as well as an overall, aggravated tone, are echoed frequently in Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s piece.  My predilection for the Russian composer&rsquo;s style must have preempted my ability to digest <em>Tasso</em> though, as its capricious emotional landscape literally left me a little confused.</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/concerto/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">concerto</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/review/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">review</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/the-third-concerto/>The Third Concerto, 100 Years Strong</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://alexchao.github.io/>&copy; Alex Chao 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
