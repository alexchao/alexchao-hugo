Perhaps the effectiveness of the raised fifth lies in the fact that it forms an augmented triad sitting squarely between the tonic and its relative minor.  In the above passage for instance, the <em>tremolo</em> in the violins below the flute line oscillates steadily between B-natural and C-sharp, necessarily visiting C-natural along the way, and as a result, creating a conflation of E major and C-sharp minor over the course of the phrase.  Actually a pretty common pattern in tonal music. Raising the dominant pitch or lowering the sixth, almost surreptitiously like this, is a device that shows up pretty often in modern film music too, in order to achieve an effect similar to what I tried to describe with my terrible sunlight-through-the-clouds metaphor.  At the very end of <a href="http://www.soundtrack.net/composers/database/?id=171" title="John Powell">John Powell</a>&rsquo;s score to <em>X-Men: The Last Stand</em>, a trombone can be heard voicing an F-natural just as the rest of the orchestra settles into an A major chord.  Listen for it at around 0:18-0:21, just before the suspended cymbal washes over everything (might be loud if you had your speakers turned up for <em>The Rock</em>).</p><p><a href=https://alexchaocom.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/2b261-powell-x-men.mp3>John Powell, X-Men: The Last Stand</a> (end credits)</p><p>As a result of mulling over this idea in my head, I&rsquo;m starting to hear it more and more in a lot of other pieces: Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s <em>Spring</em> cantata and John Knowles Paine&rsquo;s overture to <em>As You Like It</em>, to name a few.  I&rsquo;d like to revisit those pieces in this context some time later.  To be clear though, there&rsquo;s a difference between overtly <em>stating</em> an augmented triad and just subtly sneaking in a raised fifth here and there.  The former can be a discrete, indispensable stage in a harmonic progression; the latter is more of a musical device for adding or enhancing color.</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/film-score/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">film score</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/james-horner-and-the-lydian-mode/>James Horner and the Lydian Mode</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://alexchao.github.io/>&copy; Alex Chao 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
