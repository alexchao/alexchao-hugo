It was a joke instantiated in several forms and reiterated almost <em>ad nauseam</em> that we&rsquo;ve all sold our souls to one of the most difficult instruments to play. Laughs of solidarity on this topic sounded from dawn till dusk. Memorable performances from the day included the world premiere of a piece for horn quartet called <em>VA 22211</em> and a horn choir rendition of an aria from Mendelssohn&rsquo;s <em>Elijah</em> oratorio (&ldquo;O rest in the Lord&rdquo;). <em>VA 22211</em>, named in reference to the zip code of Arlington National Cemetery, pays tribute to our fallen heroes and explores a range of feelings from hymnal reverence to heroic fervor. The Mendelssohn selection felt to me more sacred and spiritual in an all-horn setting than in its original scoring for orchestra and soprano. Its cadential C major chord freed me of all worldly cares, if only for a few moments.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://alexchao.github.io/>&copy; Alex Chao 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
