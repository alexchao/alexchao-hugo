It was a joke instantiated in several forms and reiterated almost ad nauseam that we’ve all sold our souls to one of the most difficult instruments to play. Laughs of solidarity on this topic sounded from dawn till dusk. Memorable performances from the day included the world premiere of a piece for horn quartet called VA 22211 and a horn choir rendition of an aria from Mendelssohn’s Elijah oratorio (“O rest in the Lord”). VA 22211, named in reference to the zip code of Arlington National Cemetery, pays tribute to our fallen heroes and explores a range of feelings from hymnal reverence to heroic fervor. The Mendelssohn selection felt to me more sacred and spiritual in an all-horn setting than in its original scoring for orchestra and soprano. Its cadential C major chord freed me of all worldly cares, if only for a few moments.\n","wordCount":"233","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2015-04-08T08:04:37Z","dateModified":"2015-04-08T08:04:37Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://alexchao.github.io/posts/south-bay-horn-day-2015/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Alex Chao","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://alexchao.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://alexchao.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Alex Chao (Alt + H)">Alex Chao</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://alexchao.github.io/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://alexchao.github.io/archive/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://alexchao.github.io/music/ title=Music><span>Music</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>South Bay Horn Day 2015</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2015-04-08 08:04:37 +0000 UTC'>April 8, 2015</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>This past Saturday, I attended <a href=http://norcal.hornsociety.org/ title="South Bay Horn Day">South Bay Horn Day</a> at Mountain View High School.
