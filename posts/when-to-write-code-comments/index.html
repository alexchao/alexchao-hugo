Don&rsquo;t write comments to describe what the code is doing.
Code written in an imperative way can be read line by line to determine what processing is being performed. Re-stating the logic or steps of execution in a comment runs the risk of the comment falling out of sync with the code and becoming outdated.
If a section of imperative code gets big, unwieldy, and hard to read, that&rsquo;s probably a sign that a refactoring is needed and some abstractions need to be introduced."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.104.0"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><meta property="og:title" content="When to Write Code Comments"><meta property="og:description" content="Generally speaking, my advice on this topic would be:
