At least we get a sense from this statement that Sibelius believed the piano to have merits within reach of the talents of <em>other</em> composers.  I think most people would cite <strong>Chopin</strong> as the composer who excelled most in the domain of the 88; it&rsquo;s comforting to know that Sibelius, a man who didn&rsquo;t even like the instrument, was sympathetic to this belief as well. <strong>Source</strong>: Goulding, Phil.
