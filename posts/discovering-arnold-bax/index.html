I hadn&rsquo;t heard of Bax before, and as I sat there browsing the Action & Adventure category of movie selections, I stopped to take note of the piece&rsquo;s harmonic language and use of orchestral color. It was exactly the kind of early 20th century writing that I&rsquo;ve come to love and obsessively seek out. (Not the atonal writing of Schoenberg and co., as should be obvious, but the fusion of Romanticism and Impressionism that labored on in the attic of the classical household through the mid-century.)

It features a playful opening melody that dances along throughout the piece with treatment from various voices. I look forward to exploring and discovering more of Bax&rsquo;s music. His life spans a period of time that is nearly coincident with Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s â€” they lived to about the same age and were separated by about ten years. So far, I&rsquo;ve found no evidence to believe that they knew of each other, but they seem to draw from many of the same influences. More on this fellow at a later time.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://alexchao.github.io/>&copy; Alex Chao 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
