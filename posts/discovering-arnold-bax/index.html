It was exactly the kind of early 20th century writing that I’ve come to love and obsessively seek out.

It features a playful opening melody that dances along throughout the piece with treatment from various voices.\nI look forward to exploring and discovering more of Bax’s music. His life spans a period of time that is nearly coincident with Rachmaninoff’s — they lived to about the same age and were separated by about ten years.
